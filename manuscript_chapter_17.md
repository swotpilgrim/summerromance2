# Chapter 17: The Race Invitation

Thursday afternoon at Palmetto Beach felt different. Lighter. Danny had passed his algebra exam four days ago, and the success still glowed around him like a halo. Even the secret nature of our meetings couldn't dampen the sense of possibility that had opened up.

We'd worked through a few algebra problems—more for show than necessity now—but both of us knew the tutoring was essentially over. He didn't need me to teach him anymore. We were here because neither of us wanted to stop being here.

"So the carburetor is running perfect now," Danny said, stretched out on the blanket beside me, gesturing as he explained his latest modifications. "I adjusted the fuel-air mixture, fine-tuned the timing. She's purring like a kitten."

I sketched lazily in my notebook—the curve of the palm fronds overhead, the line of the horizon—only half-listening to the technical details. Mostly I was watching Danny's face, the animation there when he talked about something he loved.

"The race is next Saturday," he continued. "July 4th weekend. Should be the biggest turnout we've had all summer. Snake's been talking big about beating me, but—"

He stopped mid-sentence. I looked up to find him watching me with an expression I couldn't quite read. Serious. A little nervous.

"What?" I asked.

"I want you there."

My pencil stilled. "At the race?"

"Yeah." He sat up, turning to face me fully. "I want you there watching. It matters to me that you're there."

My mind immediately jumped to logistics and consequences. "Danny, my father explicitly forbid—"

"I know." His voice was gentle but determined. "I know what I'm asking. But Betty Ann, this race is important. Not just for the prize money, though my family needs that. It's... it's proof. That I can do something well. That I'm not just the screwup everyone expects. And I want you to see it. I want you there."

"Saturday evening at the highway strip," I said slowly, thinking through what that meant. "Where all the racing crowd goes. Where I'd be seen by everyone."

"Where you'd be publicly associated with me and my world, yeah." Danny's jaw tightened. "I know it's asking a lot. Your father would be furious if he found out. It's the kind of event good girls don't attend. Being seen there would cement every reputation issue he's worried about."

"It's illegal racing," I added, working through the implications out loud. "If the police showed up—"

"They won't. They never do. Local cops look the other way." He paused. "But yes, technically it's illegal. Technically you'd be attending something your father specifically forbade. Technically this would be the line you haven't crossed yet."

I stared at him, mind racing. Everything we'd done so far—the beach meetings, the secret tutoring, even the malt shop celebration—could be spun as innocent if discovered. Tutoring got out of hand, feelings developed, but nothing truly scandalous.

Attending an illegal street race was different. That was deliberate rebellion. That was choosing Danny's world over my father's rules in a way that couldn't be explained away.

"Why is this so important to you?" I asked. "Why does it matter if I'm there?"

Danny was quiet for a moment, choosing words carefully. "Because racing is the one thing that's completely mine. Not for my family, not because I have to, not to prove something to anyone. When I'm racing, I'm just... free. And I want to share that with you. I want you to see that part of me."

The vulnerability in his voice made my chest tight. "Danny—"

"And because I'm scared," he admitted, looking away. "I'm scared that once the tutoring is officially over, once I don't have an excuse to see you, you'll drift back to your world and I'll be left in mine. Asking you to come to the race is asking you to choose. To make a statement about which world you want to be part of."

"That's not fair," I whispered.

"I know. I'm sorry." He ran a hand through his hair. "You don't have to. I'll understand if you can't, if the risk is too much. I just..." He met my eyes. "I just want you to know how much it would mean to me."

I looked at him—this boy who'd worked himself to exhaustion to pass algebra, who supported three siblings at nineteen, who'd taught me what bravery looked like. Who'd seen me as more than the good daughter and helped me see myself that way too.

The race was Saturday. I could tell my parents I was sleeping at Sandy's Friday night for an early Saturday church bake sale prep. Sandy had reluctantly covered for me before; maybe she would again. It would be a calculated deception, premeditated in a way my previous lies hadn't been.

If I got caught, my father would follow through on his Georgia threat. I knew that with certainty. This wasn't sneaking to the beach—this was attending exactly the kind of event he'd warned me against. With exactly the kind of people. In exactly the kind of situation that confirmed his worst fears.

But looking at Danny's hopeful, uncertain face, I realized something: I'd already made my choice. Weeks ago when I'd first climbed into his world. I'd been too scared to see it fully, but I'd chosen him when I'd started lying to my parents. When I'd kept meeting him despite the rules. When I'd held his hand in the malt shop knowing people would talk.

Attending the race was just making that choice public.

"Okay," I said, the word coming out steady despite my pounding heart.

Danny's eyes widened. "Okay?"

"I'll be there. Saturday evening. I'll watch you race."

"Betty Ann, are you sure?" His expression showed he was both thrilled and concerned. "If your father finds out—"

"He'll find out eventually." The certainty settled into my bones. "Whether it's the race or something else, eventually he'll discover I've been seeing you. I'd rather it be because I chose to be there for something important to you than because someone saw us sneaking around."

"You're really sure?"

I wasn't sure. I was terrified. But I nodded anyway. "I'm sure. Tell me when and where to be."

Joy broke across Danny's face like sunrise. He pulled me into a hug that lifted me off the blanket, both of us laughing.

"Saturday evening, six o'clock, the highway strip east of town," he said when he set me down. "Park on the shoulder near mile marker 15. You'll see the cars gathered. Just follow the crowd."

"Okay." My practical mind kicked in. "I'll need a cover story. I'll tell my parents I'm staying at Sandy's Friday night to help with Saturday morning bake sale prep."

Danny's expression flickered with discomfort. "I don't like you lying for me."

"I'm not lying for you. I'm lying for us." I took his hand. "I'm making a choice to be part of your life, and sometimes that requires... strategic truth management."

"That's a fancy way of saying deception."

"Yes. It is." I met his eyes. "I'm not proud of lying to my parents. But I'm not willing to give you up just because they can't see what I see. So until I can figure out how to make them understand, I lie."

"Betty Ann—"

"I know what I'm doing, Danny. I know the risks. I'm choosing to take them. For you. For us." I squeezed his hand. "Just win the race so it's worth it."

He laughed, some of the tension breaking. "No pressure."

"No pressure," I agreed, grinning.

We spent the rest of the session talking about the race—what to expect, who would be there, what the course would look like. Danny's excitement was infectious, and I found myself genuinely looking forward to it despite the knot of anxiety in my stomach.

As the sun started to set and I needed to leave, Danny walked me to where we'd part ways. At the corner, he stopped and turned to face me, suddenly serious again.

"Thank you," he said quietly. "For being brave enough to come. I know it costs you."

"You're worth the cost."

He cupped my face gently, thumbs brushing my cheekbones. "I'll make sure it's worth it. I promise."

"Just be safe. Win or lose, just be safe."

"Always." He leaned forward slowly, giving me time to pull away, and pressed a soft kiss to my forehead. "See you Saturday."

"Saturday," I echoed.

I walked home as the sun painted the sky orange and pink, my heart a complicated tangle of excitement and terror. I was really doing this. Attending an illegal street race. Making a public statement about choosing Danny. Crossing the line from good daughter to rebel.

The thought should have scared me more than it did.

At dinner, I mentioned casually that I'd be staying at Sandy's Friday night to help with early Saturday baking. My father grunted acknowledgment. My mother asked what we'd be making. I invented details about cookies and pies, the lies flowing smoothly now.

I hated how easy it had become.

That night, lying in bed, I thought about Saturday. About standing on the sidelines watching Danny race. About being seen there by people who'd tell other people. About the inevitable moment when my father would find out.

The consequences would be severe. I knew that. But sitting in the malt shop watching Danny glow with success, I'd realized something important: safe wasn't the same as happy. Perfect wasn't the same as real.

Danny made me feel real. Seen. Brave. Like I was living my own life instead of performing someone else's idea of what my life should be.

That was worth fighting for. Worth risking for.

Worth attending an illegal street race for.

Saturday suddenly felt impossibly far away and terrifyingly close simultaneously. Five days until I made my choice public. Five days until the good daughter became something else entirely.

Five days until I either proved to Danny that I was choosing him completely, or lost my nerve and showed him I was exactly who his racing buddies said I was—a good girl who'd bail when things got real.

I wouldn't bail. I was done bailing.

Saturday. Mile marker 15. Six o'clock.

I'd be there.

Whatever came next, I'd face it. But I wouldn't face it wondering "what if." I wouldn't be the girl who chose safety over truth.

Danny had asked me to choose. So I chose him.

The decision settled into my bones with a rightness that felt like coming home.
