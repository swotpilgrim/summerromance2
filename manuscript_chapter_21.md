# Chapter 21: Danny's Decision

Danny Cole sat in his makeshift garage Tuesday evening, supposedly working on his hot rod's engine but mostly just staring at chrome parts without seeing them. His lip had finally stopped bleeding Sunday night, though it was still swollen and tender. His knuckles were scabbed over. The physical injuries would heal.

The other damage was permanent.

He'd replayed Saturday night a thousand times. Betty Ann's face when her father arrived. The devastation in her eyes as she climbed into that truck. The way she'd looked back at him—not with blame, but with something worse. Heartbreak.

He'd done that to her. By asking her to come to the race, by getting into that fight with Snake, by being exactly the troublemaker her father thought he was.

Tommy appeared in the garage doorway, hesitant. "Danny? Can we talk?"

"Not really in the mood, buddy."

"I heard you talking to Mom. About leaving." Tommy came closer, his thirteen-year-old face serious beyond his years. "Is it true? Are you leaving Coral Bay?"

Danny set down the wrench he'd been holding without using. "I'm thinking about it."

"Because of Betty Ann."

It wasn't a question. Tommy was too smart not to see the truth.

"Because I ruined her life," Danny said flatly. "Her father was right about me. I got her grounded, destroyed her reputation, turned her into someone who lies to her parents. Everything he said I'd do, I did."

"She chose to come to the race—"

"Because I asked her to!" Danny's voice rose with frustration. "I knew what it would cost her and I asked anyway. Because I was selfish. Because I wanted her there."

"That's not selfish. That's love."

The word hung in the air. Love. Yeah, he loved Betty Ann Morrison. Which was exactly the problem.

"Tommy, you don't understand. Betty Ann has this whole future ahead of her—college, art school, opportunities. And I'm..." He gestured at the shabby garage, the run-down neighborhood beyond. "I'm stuck here. Working nights at the marina. Barely passing school. Supporting our family because we have no other choice. What can I possibly offer her except dragging her down to my level?"

"Maybe she doesn't see it as down," Tommy suggested quietly. "Maybe she just sees it as where you are."

"Then she's not thinking clearly."

"Or maybe you're not."

Before Danny could respond, their mother appeared. Elena Cole looked tired—she always looked tired these days—but her eyes were sharp as she studied her eldest son.

"Tommy, go inside and help Sarah with her homework," she said.

Tommy left reluctantly. Elena moved to sit on the overturned milk crate Danny usually reserved for his brother, her waitress uniform rumpled from a long shift.

"You're planning to leave," she said. Not a question.

"How did you—"

"I'm your mother. I know when you're planning something stupid." She folded her hands in her lap. "So let me ask you something, mijo. Do you love this girl?"

Danny's throat tightened. "Yeah. I love her."

"Does she love you?"

"She says she does. But—"

"No buts. Does Betty Ann love you?"

"Yes," he admitted. "But her father's right, Mom. I have nothing to offer her. No prospects, no education, no way to give her the life she deserves. Staying in Coral Bay, staying with me, means she gives up everything. How can I ask her to do that?"

Elena was quiet for a long moment. Then she started talking, her voice soft with memory.

"When I met your father, my parents were furious. He was a fisherman with no education, no money, no prospects. They wanted me to marry Miguel Ruiz—his father owned the pharmacy, he was going to college, he had a 'future.'" She smiled slightly. "But I chose your father anyway. You know why?"

Danny shook his head.

"Because when I was with Miguel, I felt small. Like I had to fit myself into the shape of what he expected. But with your father, I felt like myself. Like I could breathe." Her eyes glistened. "Twenty years together before he died. Some of them hard, most of them happy. I never regretted choosing him over the comfortable life my parents wanted for me."

"But look at where that got you," Danny said, gesturing at their worn surroundings. "Working doubles at the diner, struggling to make rent, raising four kids alone. Would you have been better off with Miguel Ruiz?"

"No." Her answer was immediate and certain. "I would have been comfortable with Miguel. But I wouldn't have been happy. There's a difference, Danny. A big one."

"Betty Ann's father thinks I'll make her miserable—"

"Betty Ann's father doesn't get to decide what makes his daughter happy. Only she does." Elena reached over and took Danny's scarred hands. "Are you leaving because you think it's best for her? Or because you're scared?"

The question hit too close to the truth. "What if I can't be enough for her?"

"What if she gets to decide what's enough?" His mother squeezed his hands. "Mijo, listen to me. Love is not about what you can offer. It's not about prospects or education or money. It's about seeing someone truly and choosing them anyway. If Betty Ann sees you—really sees you—and she's choosing you, then who are you to tell her she's wrong?"

"But her father—"

"Will either come around or he won't. But that's between Betty Ann and her father. Not between you and Betty Ann." She stood, her knees creaking slightly. "You leaving without talking to her first, without giving her a say—that's you making the same mistake her father's making. Deciding for her instead of with her."

Danny stared at his mother, her words settling into his chest like stones. Or maybe like truth.

"What if she realizes her father was right?" he asked quietly. "What if she regrets choosing me?"

"Then you deal with it together. But Danny, if you leave without even trying, you'll always wonder what if. And so will she." Elena touched his cheek gently. "Don't rob her of the chance to choose her own path. Even if that path is hard."

After his mother went inside, Danny sat in the garage for another hour, wrestling with fear and hope and doubt.

He'd won the race money. Five hundred dollars that would cover rent and bills for three months. His family was stable for now. He could leave—find work in the next town, send money back, start over somewhere Betty Ann's reputation wouldn't be damaged by association with him.

It would be the noble thing. The selfless thing. Removing himself so she could have the future her father wanted for her.

But his mother's words echoed: *Don't rob her of the chance to choose her own path.*

And Tommy's: *That's not selfish. That's love.*

The sock hop was Friday. He'd heard about it from Rico—the big July 4th community dance at the high school gym. Everyone would be there. Betty Ann probably wouldn't be allowed to attend, but maybe...

Maybe what? Maybe he could see her there? Talk to her? Ask her what she wanted instead of assuming he knew?

The idea terrified him. Because what if she'd realized her father was right? What if being grounded, facing consequences, had shown her that Danny Cole wasn't worth the cost?

But not knowing—leaving without asking—felt worse.

He thought about Betty Ann's face at the malt shop when he'd passed his exam. The way she'd looked at him at the race before everything went wrong. The certainty in her voice when she'd told her father *I love him.*

She'd fought for him. Risked everything for him. The least he could do was stick around long enough to let her make her own choice.

Even if that choice was to walk away.

Danny made his decision. He wouldn't leave Friday. He'd go to the sock hop—not to make a scene, just to be there in case Betty Ann found a way to come. To give her the chance to tell him what she wanted.

If she told him to leave, he would. But he wouldn't leave without hearing it from her first.

He returned to working on the engine, but this time with purpose instead of distraction. Adjusting, fine-tuning, making sure everything was perfect. Not for racing—for staying. For building a life here if Betty Ann chose him.

For being brave enough to let her choose.

Tommy reappeared an hour later. "So? Are you still leaving?"

"Not until I talk to Betty Ann," Danny said. "Not until I hear from her what she wants."

Tommy's grin was bright enough to light the whole garage. "Good. Because leaving would have been really, really stupid."

"Yeah," Danny agreed, allowing himself a small smile. "It really would have been."

He just hoped Betty Ann wanted him to stay.
