# Chapter 4: Disaster at the Library

I arrived at the Coral Bay Public Library at exactly one forty-five on Tuesday afternoon.

Fifteen minutes early, as always. I smoothed my best Sunday dress—pale pink with white buttons up to my collar—and pushed through the heavy oak doors.

The library was blessedly cool. Mrs. Kowalski, the head librarian, looked up from her desk with her permanent sour expression.

"Good afternoon, Mrs. Kowalski."

She nodded curtly.

I chose a table near the back and unpacked my supplies with military precision. Algebra textbook in the center. My notebook with carefully prepared lesson plans to the left. Pencils, erasers, and graph paper on the right. Everything ready.

I checked my watch. One fifty-five.

Two o'clock came. No Danny.

I waited, watching the door. The library's clock ticked loudly.

Two ten. Still no Danny.

Of course. I'd known this would happen. This was a waste of my time.

The door banged open.

Danny Cole slouched in forty-three minutes late.

He wore his leather jacket despite the heat, jeans torn at the knee, boots tracking dirt. Mrs. Kowalski glared. He didn't notice.

The smell of motor oil followed him as he sauntered to my table. Not hurried. Not apologetic.

He dropped into the chair across from me. His dark eyes held amusement.

"Hey."

No apology. No acknowledgment of being late. Just hey.

"You're forty-three minutes late." I kept my voice level, but barely. "We have a one-hour session. You've wasted almost half of it."

He shrugged. "Had to work on my car."

"You had to—" I bit off the angry words trying to escape. "Danny, if you're going to do this, you need to take it seriously. That means being on time. It means being prepared. It means respecting my time—"

"Your time?" One dark eyebrow rose. "Princess, I didn't ask for this. They're making me do this. You're getting something out of it too, right? Isn't that how this works?"

Princess. He'd called me princess like it was an insult.

"My name is Betty Ann."

"Whatever you say, princess." The smirk grew.

Mrs. Kowalski's sharp "SHHHH!" cut through the tension.

I took a breath. Counted to five. Reminded myself that I needed this for my grade, that fighting with him wouldn't help either of us, that I just had to get through six weeks.

"Let's start." I opened the textbook to Chapter One. "We'll begin with basic linear equations. Did you bring any materials?"

He stared at me.

"Notebook? Pencil?"

"Didn't know I needed any."

I bit back a response and slid a pencil and graph paper across the table.

"Linear equations are equations where the highest power of the variable is one. For example: x + 3 = 7. To solve for x, we isolate the variable by subtracting three from both sides."

I wrote out the problem, showing each step. "See? Now you try this one." I wrote: x + 5 = 12.

Danny stared at the paper. His pencil hovered over it, not moving.

Then he started drawing.

Not solving the equation. Drawing. A car, of all things. A detailed sketch of what looked like his hot rod, complete with chrome details.

"Danny."

He kept drawing.

"Danny, you need to pay attention."

"I am paying attention." He added wheels to the car.

"You're drawing."

"I can listen and draw."

"That's not how learning works."

"Maybe that's not how you learn." He finally looked up, meeting my eyes with a challenge in his.

Heat flooded my face. "If you're not even going to try—"

"I am trying." But his tone said he wasn't, not really.

"SHHHHH!" Mrs. Kowalski's voice cracked like a whip.

We both fell silent, glaring at each other.

I tried again. Explained the concept three different ways. Each time, his eyes glazed over. Not understanding. Not trying. Just waiting for time to pass.

Finally, I set down my pencil with more force than necessary.

"Do you even care about passing?"

The question hung between us, sharp and accusing.

Something shifted in Danny's expression. His defensive walls, already high, slammed completely shut.

"I care about racing," he said, voice flat. "School's just something I have to get through."

"If that's how you feel, then why am I wasting my time trying to help you?"

"Nobody asked you to help." He leaned back, arms crossing. "This wasn't my idea. They assigned you to me like I'm some charity case project. Rich girl helping the poor dumb kid from the marina, right? That make you feel good about yourself?"

"I am not rich!" The words came out louder than I meant. Mrs. Kowalski's head snapped up, but I didn't care anymore. "My father owns a hardware store. We live in a regular house. We're not—"

"Compared to where I live, you're rich." His voice had gone cold. "Compared to my life, you've never had a problem. You've never had to choose between eating and keeping the lights on. You've never—" He stopped himself, jaw tight. "You don't know anything about me."

"And you don't know anything about me!" I shot back. "You think I want to be here? You think I don't have my own algebra to study? My own problems to worry about? You think my life is perfect just because I show up on time and try hard?"

"Compared to mine, yeah. It's perfect."

We stared at each other, breathing hard, the hostility thick enough to choke on.

"Young lady." Mrs. Kowalski materialized beside our table like a vengeful ghost. "Young man. If you cannot keep your voices down, I will ask you both to leave. This is a library, not a boxing ring."

"Yes, ma'am," I whispered.

"Sorry," Danny muttered.

Mrs. Kowalski drifted back to her desk, disapproval radiating from every fiber of her cardigan.

The silence stretched. All my careful plans, useless. He didn't want to learn. I didn't want to spend my summer fighting with someone who resented me.

The clock struck three thirty.

"That's our time."

"Great." Danny stood immediately.

"Next session is Thursday. Two o'clock. Be on time."

"Whatever."

He was already walking away, boots heavy on the floor.

This was impossible.

He didn't want to learn. He resented me for trying to teach him. I resented him for wasting my time. How was I supposed to tutor someone who hated me? Someone who couldn't even bother to show up on time or bring a pencil?

I gathered my things slowly, exhaustion settling into my bones.

Mrs. Kowalski watched me pass her desk. For just a moment, I thought I saw sympathy in her stern expression. But then she looked back down at her book, and I walked out into the blazing afternoon sun, blinking against the sudden brightness.

The walk home felt longer than usual. My Sunday dress stuck to my back with sweat. My bag weighed a thousand pounds. By the time I reached my street, I was fighting tears.

This was my summer now. Three days a week fighting with Danny Cole. Three days a week accomplishing nothing. Three days a week of being called princess by someone who'd already decided I wasn't worth knowing.

I climbed the porch steps and let myself inside, grateful Mama was at the church and Daddy was at the store. I didn't want to explain why I looked like I'd been through a war.

In my room, I set my bag down and stared at my planner, still open to today's date. 2:00 PM - Tutor Danny Cole (library).

I picked up my pen and wrote: Disaster.

Meanwhile, Danny drove too fast toward the marina district, hands gripping the steering wheel hard enough to hurt.

She didn't understand anything. Didn't understand that he'd worked until six that morning. Didn't understand that he'd gone home to find no food in the house because Marco had eaten the last of the bread for breakfast. Didn't understand that he'd given his lunch money to Sarah so she could buy milk at school. Didn't understand that he'd shown up at all when every bone in his body wanted to sleep for about sixteen hours straight.

Rich girl. With her pressed dress and her neat handwriting and her lecture about respecting her time.

Like his time wasn't valuable.

Like he had time to waste sitting in a library listening to someone explain things that wouldn't make sense no matter how many times he heard them.

Math had never been this hard before his dad died. He'd pulled B's and C's without trying much. But that was back when he slept at night and stayed awake in class and had brain cells that weren't too exhausted to think straight.

Now algebra looked like gibberish. Betty Ann's careful explanations turned into white noise. And he couldn't even tell her why because then she'd know. She'd know his life was a disaster. She'd pity him. Or worse, she'd think he was making excuses.

He pulled up to his house and sat in the car for a long moment, staring at the peeling paint and sagging roof.

Six weeks of this. Six weeks of Betty Ann Morrison looking at him like he was stupid. Six weeks of failing to understand things everyone else found easy. Six weeks of her time and her charity and her judgment.

But also six weeks until the race. Six weeks until he could win that five hundred dollars and prove everyone wrong about Danny Cole.

He could survive six weeks of anything for that.

Even her.
