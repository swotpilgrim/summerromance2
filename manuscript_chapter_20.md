# Chapter 20: Grounded

Sunday morning arrived with pale sunlight through my curtains and the worst headache I'd ever experienced. My eyes were swollen nearly shut from crying, my face felt puffy, and my mouth tasted like regret.

I lay in bed listening to my parents move around downstairs, their voices low and occasional. Normal Sunday routine—my father would read the paper with coffee, my mother would prep for church. Except this Sunday, nothing was normal.

A knock on my door made me sit up. "Yes?"

"We're leaving for church," my father's voice came through the wood. "You're staying home. I've locked the phone in my office. Don't leave this room except for the bathroom."

The door didn't open. He didn't come in. The distance felt like miles.

"Okay," I said to the closed door.

Their footsteps retreated. The front door opened and closed. The house fell into silence broken only by the tick of the hallway clock.

I was being left home from church. In seventeen years, I'd never missed Sunday service unless genuinely ill. The exclusion was its own punishment—everyone would notice my absence, would wonder why perfect Betty Ann Morrison wasn't in her usual pew.

And someone—Mrs. Patterson, probably—would explain exactly why.

I got up and looked at myself in the mirror. I barely recognized the girl staring back. Swollen eyes, tear-stained cheeks, hair a mess. I looked like I'd been through a war.

Maybe I had.

I washed my face, changed into fresh clothes, tried to make myself presentable even though no one would see me. The act of normal routine helped calm the chaos inside.

But then there was nothing to do. No phone to call Sandy. No way to reach Danny. No escape from the four walls of my room and the spiraling thoughts in my head.

I pulled out my sketchbook and tried to draw, but my hands shook too much. Tried to read but couldn't focus. Tried to write in my diary but the words wouldn't come.

So I sat on my bed and replayed last night over and over. Danny's win. His joy. The fight. My father's face. The accusation in his voice when he'd listed all the ways Danny was wrong for me.

And my own voice, defiant and certain: *I love him.*

I did. I loved Danny Cole. Not the puppy-love crush my father dismissed it as, but real love that had grown from seeing each other clearly. From being seen clearly in return.

But was love enough? My father's words echoed: *What about when you're thirty and looking back at everything you gave up?*

What if he was right? What if I was throwing away college, art school, every opportunity for a romance that would fizzle when reality set in?

No. I pushed the doubt away. My father was wrong. He had to be wrong.

Because if he was right, I'd destroyed my relationship with my parents for nothing.

They returned home two hours later. I heard them enter, heard the rustle of my mother preparing lunch. No one called me down.

At one o'clock, my mother knocked. "I'm leaving a sandwich outside your door."

"Thank you."

Her footsteps retreated without another word.

I opened the door to find a turkey sandwich on a plate, neatly made but impersonal. Like something you'd give a stranger. I ate it mechanically, tasting nothing.

The afternoon crawled. Three o'clock became four became five. I watched the clock hands move with agonizing slowness, trapped in this room with my thoughts.

I thought about Danny constantly. Was he okay? Did his lip need stitches? Did he regret asking me to the race? Did he blame himself for getting me caught?

I had no way to know. No way to reach him. The isolation was its own torture.

Monday morning, my father drove me to work in complete silence. At the hardware store, he positioned me in the back stockroom where I wouldn't interact with customers much. Where I wouldn't have opportunities to use the phone or be seen by people who'd heard about Saturday night.

I worked mechanically, organizing paint cans and restocking shelves, while conversations from the front reached me in fragments.

"...heard she was at the races..."
"...that Cole boy got in a fight..."
"...Morrison family must be devastated..."

By lunchtime, the whole town knew. By evening, the gossip had spread to everyone who hadn't been there. Betty Ann Morrison, caught at illegal street races. Dating the troublemaker from the marina district. Lying to her parents. Throwing her life away.

Mrs. Patterson came in twice Monday, clearly fishing for information. Both times my father intercepted her before she could corner me, but I heard their low conversation and Mrs. Patterson's faux-concerned tone.

The judgment was crushing.

Tuesday evening, my mother allowed Sandy to visit—supervised, in the living room, with Helen sitting in the corner knitting.

Sandy looked at me with a mixture of pity and "I told you so." We sat on opposite ends of the sofa, careful distance between us.

"How are you holding up?" Sandy asked.

"I've been better."

"Your parents are really upset."

"I know."

Sandy glanced at my mother, then lowered her voice slightly. "I heard from Jenn, who heard from Rico, who heard from Danny's brother Tommy..." She paused. "Danny's planning to leave town."

The words hit like a physical blow. "What?"

"Not right away. But soon. After things settle. He won the race money, his family's bills are paid for a few months. He's thinking about going to the next town over, finding work, sending money back."

"Why?" But I knew why even before Sandy answered.

"Because he thinks he's ruining your life. Because being with you has cost you everything and he can't watch it happen anymore."

The room spun. Danny was leaving. Because of me. Because loving me had brought consequences he couldn't bear watching me endure.

"I have to talk to him," I said urgently.

"How? You're grounded. Your father watches you constantly."

"I don't know, but I have to—"

"Betty Ann." Sandy's voice was gentle but firm. "Maybe it's better this way. You're grounded now, but eventually your parents will ease up. You'll go to college. You'll have opportunities. Danny leaving might be... freeing you to have the future you're supposed to have."

"He is my future," I said fiercely.

Sandy just looked at me with sad, knowing eyes. Like she was watching me throw my life away and couldn't stop it.

After she left, I sat in my room processing the information. Danny was leaving. Sacrificing himself to protect me, to give me back my future. Making the decision for both of us instead of letting me choose.

The fury that rose in me was unexpected and hot.

He didn't get to decide what was best for me. He didn't get to make my choices. I'd stood up to my father, risked everything, declared my love publicly. And Danny's response was to leave?

No. No no no.

But trapped in this room, grounded indefinitely, watched constantly—how could I stop him? How could I even talk to him?

I thought about climbing out my window. About sneaking to the library on a break from work. About any possible way to reach him.

But my father's warning echoed: *One more disobedience and you're on a bus to Georgia.*

He meant it. I knew he meant it.

So I was trapped. Danny was leaving. And there was nothing I could do about it.

---

That night I lay awake staring at the ceiling, defeat crushing me. I'd fought so hard. Risked so much. Chosen Danny despite the costs.

And I was losing him anyway.

Not because my father won. Not because the circumstances were impossible. Because Danny was sacrificing himself to protect me, making the decision I'd explicitly told him not to make.

Love meant fighting, not running away. He'd said that once, I was sure of it. So why was he running now?

The answer was obvious: because watching me suffer was worse than leaving.

But him leaving would destroy me worse than any grounding or gossip or parental disappointment.

I had to reach him. Had to make him understand that I chose him, would keep choosing him, that leaving wasn't protecting me—it was abandoning me.

But how?

The question kept me awake until dawn, with no answers appearing.

Danny was leaving. My father had won. And I was trapped in this room, in this town, in this life I didn't choose.

Unless I did something drastic. Something irreversible.

An idea began forming in the pre-dawn darkness. Dangerous. Terrifying. Exactly the kind of thing the old Betty Ann would never consider.

But the old Betty Ann wouldn't have climbed out her window to attend illegal street races either.

The sock hop was Friday night. A week away. My father would forbid me to attend—that was certain. He'd probably lock me in my room again.

But what if I climbed out anyway? What if I found Danny before he left and told him he didn't get to make this decision alone? What if I chose defiance one more time, permanently this time, consequences be damned?

The thought should have terrified me more than it did.

Maybe I'd already lost everything that mattered. Maybe one more act of rebellion would just confirm what my father already believed—that I'd chosen Danny over the family.

Maybe that's exactly what I needed to do.

The sun rose on a new resolve. I didn't know how yet. But I'd reach Danny. I'd stop him from leaving. And I'd do it at the one place everyone in town would see—the July 4th sock hop.

Public declaration. Public choice. No more secrets.

If I was going to lose everything anyway, I'd lose it honestly.
