# Chapter 13: Growing Closer

I arrived at Palmetto Beach Tuesday afternoon carrying more than just textbooks and sandwiches. I carried two days' worth of doubt, Sandy's warnings echoing in my head, questions I didn't know how to ask.

The beach blanket felt heavier than usual as I spread it under our palm tree. I arranged materials with mechanical precision—textbook here, notebooks there, lunch bag to the side—trying to impose order on the chaos in my mind.

Danny's motorcycle engine announced his arrival right at two o'clock. I watched him park and walk across the sand toward me, and my traitorous heart did that stupid flutter thing it had been doing lately. He looked tired today, circles under his eyes suggesting he'd worked late at the marina. But he smiled when he saw me, and something in my chest loosened slightly.

"Hey," he said, dropping onto the blanket. Not beside me like usual, but across from me. Creating distance.

"Hey," I echoed.

We sat there for an awkward beat, both suddenly formal. All the easy comfort we'd built over the past weeks had vanished, replaced by careful politeness that felt wrong.

"So," I said, opening the textbook. "We should probably work through—"

"Is something wrong?" Danny interrupted.

I looked up, surprised. "What?"

"You seem different. Careful." His dark eyes studied my face. "Did something happen?"

"No. Nothing happened." The lie tasted bitter.

"Betty Ann."

Just my name, but the way he said it—gentle, concerned, seeing right through me—made my defenses crack.

"I had coffee with Sandy on Saturday," I admitted. "She... expressed some concerns. About the tutoring."

Danny's expression shuttered slightly. "What kind of concerns?"

"She thinks..." I struggled for the right words. How did you tell someone that your best friend thought they might be using you? "She's worried I'm getting too involved. That it might affect my reputation, my college prospects. That my parents will find out and there will be consequences."

"She's probably right," Danny said flatly.

"And she mentioned..." I forced myself to continue. "That you have a reputation. That maybe I should be more careful."

Danny's jaw tightened. "She told you I'm trouble and you should stay away."

"Something like that."

"And you believe her?"

"I don't know what to believe." The honesty burst out before I could stop it. "I barely know you, Danny. We've had, what, twelve tutoring sessions? How well can you really know someone in twelve sessions?"

"That depends on whether you're paying attention," he said quietly.

"What's that supposed to mean?"

"It means..." Danny dragged a hand through his hair, frustration clear. "Forget it. Your friend's right. I am trouble. You should probably keep this professional."

"That's not what I—"

"Isn't it?" His voice had gone defensive, walls slamming back into place. "You're questioning whether you know me, whether this is a good idea. Sandy's right that your father will hate me and your reputation will suffer and I'm from the wrong side of everything. So maybe we should just stick to algebra and stop pretending this is anything else."

The words hit like a slap. "Is that what you want?"

"What I want doesn't matter."

"Of course it matters!"

"Does it? Because it sounds like you've already decided I'm not worth the risk."

"I didn't say that!" My voice rose with frustration. "I said I don't know what to think! I have my best friend telling me one thing and my feelings telling me another and I don't know which to trust!"

"What are your feelings telling you?" Danny asked, his voice quieter now.

I looked away, unable to meet his eyes. "That's not the point."

"That's exactly the point." Danny moved closer, not touching but near enough that I could feel the heat of him. "Forget Sandy. Forget your parents. Forget everyone else for one second and tell me—what do you actually think? About me. About this."

"I think..." My throat tightened. "I think I'm scared."

"Of me?"

"Of everything. Of what it means if this is real. Of what happens if I let myself feel what I'm feeling and then..." I couldn't finish the sentence.

"And then what?" Danny pressed gently.

"And then you leave." The words came out barely above a whisper. "Once you pass algebra and don't need tutoring anymore. Once you can race. What if you go back to your world and I'm just... left here having risked everything for nothing?"

Understanding dawned on Danny's face. "That's what you're really worried about."

"Sandy said you've dated other girls. That you're experienced. And I'm just..." I gestured at myself helplessly. "The honor roll princess. The good girl. Why would you stick around for someone like me?"

"Why would you stick around for someone like me?" Danny countered. "I have nothing to offer you, Betty Ann. No money, no prospects, I'm barely passing school. I work nights loading boats and come home smelling like fish. I've got three kids depending on me and a mother who needs help and a house that's falling apart. What could you possibly want with any of that?"

"I want you," I said before I could think better of it. "Not your circumstances. You."

Danny stared at me like I'd said something in a foreign language. "You mean that?"

"Yes." And suddenly I did mean it, with absolute certainty. "Sandy doesn't know you. She sees your reputation. I see... you. The way you light up when you talk about engines. How patient you are with Tommy. The way you're sacrificing everything for your family. Your courage and your stubbornness and that rare smile when something finally clicks in algebra."

"Betty Ann—"

"I'm terrified," I continued, the words pouring out now. "Of disappointing my parents, of damaging my future, of all of it. But I'm more terrified of playing it safe my whole life and never taking a single risk. You make me brave, Danny. You make me want to be brave."

"You're already brave." His voice was rough with emotion. "You don't need me for that."

"Maybe not. But you help me see it." I finally met his eyes. "So no, I don't believe Sandy. Not really. But I needed to ask—is this real? What's happening between us? Or am I imagining it?"

"You're not imagining it." Danny reached out slowly, giving me time to pull away, and took my hand. His palm was warm, calloused, familiar. "I'm falling for you, Betty Ann Morrison. Have been since you brought those first sandwiches and pretended you'd made too many. Since you moved tutoring to the beach because you thought I'd focus better. Since you came to my garage and drew my car like it was worth drawing."

My eyes burned with tears. "You're falling for me?"

"Completely. Terrifyingly. Yes."

"I'm falling for you too," I whispered. "That's what scares me."

"Good." The ghost of a smile touched his mouth. "We can be terrified together."

The tension that had been strangling the afternoon released. I laughed, slightly hysterical, and Danny pulled me closer. We sat there, hands linked, the algebra textbook forgotten between us.

"I don't have answers," I admitted. "About my parents or my reputation or any of the practical problems."

"Me neither," Danny said. "But maybe we figure it out as we go?"

"Together?"

"Always together."

We worked through algebra problems for a while, but the quality of our interaction had shifted. The careful distance was gone, replaced by something warmer and more honest. When I explained a concept, Danny listened with full attention. When he got something right, we grinned at each other like co-conspirators.

"Tell me something," Danny said during a break, both of us staring out at the waves. "About being the perfect daughter. What's that actually like?"

I thought about how to explain. "It's exhausting. Everyone has expectations—my father wants me to be responsible and respectable. My mother wants me to be gentle and graceful. The church wants me to be a good example. Teachers want me to maintain my grades. And I try, I really try to be all those things. But it's like wearing a costume that doesn't quite fit. You keep adjusting it, but it never feels natural."

"What do you actually want? For yourself, not anyone else?"

"I want..." The answer surprised me with its clarity. "I want to make art without apologizing for it. I want to make mistakes without feeling like I'm failing everyone. I want to want things—real things, not just approved things. I want to figure out who I am when I'm not performing perfection for an audience."

"That sounds lonely," Danny said quietly. "The performing part."

"It is. Or it was." I looked at him. "You don't expect perfection. You see my sketches and call them art. You listen when I talk about wanting something different. With you, I can just... be."

"Same," Danny said. "Everyone in Coral Bay has already decided who I am. The troublemaker, the deadbeat, the kid who'll never amount to anything. But you see past that. You see me working hard, trying my best, caring about my family. You don't expect me to fail."

"I expect you to succeed," I corrected. "You're going to pass that exam."

"Because of you."

"Because of us. Both of us working together."

We fell into comfortable silence, watching the waves roll in. I became aware that we were sitting very close, shoulders touching. Neither of us moved away.

"Can I tell you something?" Danny asked.

"Anything."

"I was terrified you'd listen to Sandy. That you'd show up today and tell me we needed to keep this professional, that I was too much risk." He looked at his hands. "My racing buddies said the same thing, basically. That good girls like you don't stick around for guys like me."

"Your friends said that?"

"Snake, mostly. He's..." Danny struggled for words. "He's not wrong about the world. About how social class and reputation work. But I think—I hope—he's wrong about you."

"He's wrong about you too," I said fiercely. "You're not some deadbeat. You're nineteen years old supporting a family. That's not failure. That's heroic."

"It doesn't feel heroic. It feels like drowning most days."

"All the more reason to recognize how strong you are." I squeezed his hand. "You're doing something impossible and somehow making it work. That's not nothing, Danny."

He looked at me with such raw gratitude that my breath caught. "You really believe that."

"I really do."

"Then I guess we're both taking risks here," he said. "You're risking your reputation. I'm risking my heart."

"Your heart?"

"Yeah." His thumb brushed across my knuckles. "Because caring about you means I could get hurt when reality catches up. When your father finds out, when people start talking, when you have to choose between me and your comfortable life."

"I won't choose my comfortable life over you."

"You say that now—"

"I mean it now. And I'll mean it later." I turned to face him fully. "I'm not saying it will be easy. I'm not saying there won't be consequences. But I'm choosing this, Danny. I'm choosing you. Even scared, I'm choosing you."

Something in his expression cracked open, vulnerable and hopeful. "You're sure?"

"I'm terrified. But I'm sure."

He lifted our joined hands and kissed my knuckles gently—a gesture so tender it made my eyes sting with tears again.

"Then we're doing this," he said. "For real."

"For real."

We worked through the rest of the afternoon's problems, but everything felt different now. We'd named what was growing between us. We'd chosen each other despite the risks, despite the warnings, despite every practical reason to walk away.

As the sun started to set, casting everything in gold, Danny helped me gather our materials.

"Tuesday again?" he asked.

"And Thursday," I confirmed. "Same time, same place."

"Betty Ann?" He caught my hand before I could walk away. "Thank you. For not listening to everyone else. For listening to yourself."

"Thank you for being worth the risk."

His smile—that rare, unguarded smile—was everything.

I walked home along the beach, my heart feeling lighter than it had in days. Sandy's warnings and Snake's doubts didn't disappear. The practical problems remained. But underneath all of it was certainty: what Danny and I had was real.

We were falling for each other. We'd said it out loud, made it official, committed to figuring it out together.

The doubts would come back—I wasn't naive enough to think otherwise. But for now, walking home with sand between my toes and Danny's goodbye still warming my lips, I let myself feel the pure joy of being chosen and choosing in return.

Always together, he'd said.

I believed him.
