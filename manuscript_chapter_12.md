# Chapter 12: The Racing Crew

Danny Cole had learned early that working with his hands helped quiet his mind. When thoughts got too loud or problems felt too big, he could lose himself in the meditative rhythm of mechanical work—the precise click of a socket wrench, the satisfying give of a stubborn bolt finally loosening, the smell of motor oil and hot metal.

Sunday afternoon found him in his makeshift garage, bent over the cherry red Ford's engine, fine-tuning the carburetor for the July 4th race now only two weeks away. Tommy, his thirteen-year-old brother, sat on an overturned milk crate nearby, handing tools when asked and peppering Danny with questions about engine timing.

"So if you advance the timing too much, the engine knocks?" Tommy asked, his thin face intent with the same mechanical focus Danny recognized in himself at that age.

"Right. You want that perfect point where combustion happens just as the piston reaches top dead center." Danny adjusted a setting, listening to the engine's idle. "Too early and you get knocking. Too late and you lose power."

"Like finding the sweet spot."

"Exactly like that."

Tommy was good with this stuff—had natural hands for mechanical work. Danny hoped his little brother would get to use that talent for something more than just keeping their ancient lawnmower running. Engineering school, maybe, if Danny could save enough to help make that happen.

The sound of engines approaching pulled Danny from his thoughts. He straightened, wiping his hands on a rag as three vehicles pulled up: Snake Brennan's souped-up Chevy, Rico's Pontiac, and Frankie on his motorcycle. Their Sunday routine.

"Danny boy!" Rico called, climbing out of the Pontiac with a six-pack of Coca-Cola. "How's she running?"

"Sweet as honey," Danny said, accepting a bottle. "Should be ready for the race."

Snake unfolded himself from the Chevy, all swagger and sharp edges. Jake "Snake" Brennan had earned his nickname in middle school—something about the way he moved and the way he could strike when you weren't looking. He was twenty-one now, should have moved on from Coral Bay years ago, but here he stayed, king of a very small kingdom.

"You sure you're gonna be ready?" Snake asked, circling the Ford with an appraising eye. "I've been making some modifications myself. Might give you a run for that prize money."

"Might," Danny agreed easily. No point getting into it now. The race would settle it.

Frankie leaned against his motorcycle, lighting a cigarette. "You seem different, man. Less angry. Almost..." He pretended to think hard. "Happy? Is that the word?"

Danny felt heat creep up his neck. "I'm the same as always."

"Nah." Snake's eyes narrowed with predatory interest. "Frankie's right. You've been different lately. Less likely to pick a fight. More likely to smile for no reason. Almost human."

Rico laughed. "Leave him alone. Man's allowed to be in a good mood."

"It's that tutor girl, isn't it?" Snake's grin was sharp. "What's her name? Betty something? The honor roll princess helping our boy pass algebra?"

Tommy stiffened on his milk crate. Danny felt his jaw tighten but tried to keep his voice light. "It's just tutoring. She's helping me pass so I can race. That's all."

"That's all?" Frankie's smirk was knowing. "Come on, Danny. You've been spending, what, six hours a week with this girl? At the beach? And you expect us to believe it's just algebra?"

"Must be some kind of special tutoring," Rico added with a wink. "The kind where she teaches you extracurricular subjects?"

"Knock it off," Danny said, the lightness gone from his voice.

"Oh, he's touchy about it," Snake observed, delighted. "Guys, I think our Danny's got it bad."

"Betty Ann's nice," Tommy piped up, his young voice defiant. "She actually helps Danny. She's not like you think."

The men turned to look at Tommy, and Frankie laughed. "Even the kid's defending her. This is serious."

"Yeah?" Snake's amusement had an edge now. "Tell us about her, Tommy. Since you've apparently met the church girl."

"She came here once," Tommy said, looking to Danny for support. "To see Danny's car. She looked at it like it mattered, not like it was weird or stupid. She drew a picture of Danny working on it and it was really good. And she doesn't look at our neighborhood like..." He struggled for words. "Like it's dirty or scary. She just looked normal."

"How sweet," Snake drawled. "The good girl slumming it in the marina district to see how the other half lives."

"It wasn't like that," Tommy protested.

Danny put a hand on his brother's shoulder. "Tommy, why don't you go inside? Mom probably needs help with dinner."

"But—"

"Go on."

Tommy left reluctantly, shooting looks over his shoulder. When he was gone, Danny turned back to his friends—if they even were friends, in the traditional sense. They were more like... allies. Brothers in arms against a town that had already decided they were trouble.

"Say what you want to say," Danny told Snake. "Get it out."

"All right." Snake's casual posture shifted into something more serious. "I've known you since we were ten years old. I can read you, man. And you've got it bad for this Betty Ann Morrison. Which is hilarious because she's completely wrong for you."

"You don't know anything about her."

"I know her type," Snake countered. "Good girl, church every Sunday, probably never broken a rule in her life until she started sneaking around with you. Am I wrong?"

Danny didn't answer, which was answer enough.

"Here's what I know about girls like that," Snake continued, his voice harder now. "They like the idea of us. The danger, the rebellion, the leather jacket and fast car. It's exciting. Makes them feel wild. But it's temporary, Danny. When it gets real—when they have to bring you home to daddy or defend you to their church friends—they bail. Every time."

"Betty Ann's not like that."

"No?" Snake's laugh was harsh. "You think she's going to introduce you to her parents? Take you to Sunday services? Let her country club friends know she's seeing the guy from the marina district who races illegally and barely graduated?"

"He hasn't graduated," Rico pointed out, trying for humor that fell flat.

"Exactly," Snake said. "She's a smart girl heading to college, probably has her whole future mapped out by parents who want her safe and respectable. You think you fit into that future?"

"Maybe." But doubt crept into Danny's voice. "If she wants me to."

"Danny." Snake's tone shifted to something almost sympathetic. "I'm not trying to be a dick. I'm trying to save you some heartbreak. I've seen this before. Good girls don't end up with guys like us. They experiment, they rebel, but when it comes down to it, they choose their world. They have to."

"Betty Ann's different—"

"Is she?" Snake pressed. "Does she even know what your life is really like? Has she met your mom working doubles at the diner? Does she know you've got three kids depending on you? That you're one unpaid bill away from losing your house? That racing isn't a hobby for you—it's survival?"

Each question landed like a punch. Danny's hands clenched at his sides.

"You think she's going to stick around when her father finds out?" Snake continued relentlessly. "Because he will find out. Coral Bay's too small for secrets. And when he does, he's going to forbid it. And she's going to listen, because girls like Betty Ann Morrison always listen to daddy."

"You don't know her," Danny said, but his voice had lost its conviction.

"Maybe not. But I know how this ends. She goes back to her safe life on the right side of town. You're left here, still in the marina district, still struggling, just with a broken heart on top of it all."

Frankie shifted uncomfortably. "Snake, man, that's harsh."

"It's honest." Snake turned back to his Chevy. "I'm trying to protect him. Someone has to."

Rico stepped closer to Danny, voice low. "He's not completely wrong, you know. About the parents finding out, at least. That's going to be ugly."

Danny leaned against the Ford, suddenly exhausted. "I know."

"So what are you going to do?" Rico asked.

"I don't know." The admission tasted bitter.

Snake called from his car, "For what it's worth, if you're gonna have your heart broken, at least win the race first. Get the money. Make the pain worthwhile."

The others laughed, but Danny didn't. He watched them pile back into their vehicles and drive off—Frankie with a sympathetic wave, Rico with a brotherly shoulder squeeze, Snake with a knowing look that said *I told you so* before anything had even happened.

When they were gone, Danny returned to his car. But the meditative calm of mechanical work eluded him. His hands moved through the motions, but his mind churned.

Betty Ann's world and his world—Snake was right that they were different. Vastly different. She had parents who cared, a future planned out, opportunities waiting. He had responsibilities, burdens, a family to support. She was heading somewhere. He was stuck here.

Why would someone like Betty Ann choose someone like him, except as a temporary rebellion?

But Tommy's words echoed too: *She looked at it like it mattered. She looked normal.*

Betty Ann had come to the marina district, seen his shabby house and makeshift garage, and hadn't flinched. She'd looked at his car with genuine appreciation. She'd encouraged his dreams about opening a garage someday. She'd treated Tommy with kindness.

She'd also looked at Danny like he was more than his reputation, more than the troublemaker everyone expected him to be.

That had to mean something. Didn't it?

"Danny?" Tommy appeared in the garage doorway, hesitant. "You okay?"

"Yeah, buddy. I'm good."

"Snake's mean."

"Snake's... realistic." The words hurt to say.

"He's wrong about Betty Ann." Tommy came closer, his thirteen-year-old face earnest. "I saw how she looked at you when she was here. When you were explaining about the engine modifications. She looked at you like..." He struggled for the right comparison. "Like how you look at this car. Like you matter."

Danny's throat tightened. "You think so?"

"I know so. And I think you'd be stupid to listen to Snake instead of seeing what's right in front of you."

"When did you get so smart?"

"I've always been smart. You just don't notice because you're too busy being dramatic."

Despite everything, Danny laughed. "Get out of here. Don't you have homework?"

"It's summer."

"Then go... I don't know. Do something productive."

Tommy grinned and disappeared back into the house.

Danny returned to his work, but Snake's words had burrowed under his skin. The doubts multiplied like bacteria in a petri dish, spreading and growing.

Betty Ann's father would find out eventually. That was inevitable. And when he did, would Betty Ann stand up to him? Or would she fold, choose the path of least resistance, go back to being the good daughter who never disappointed?

She'd risked some things for their beach meetings—the beach instead of the library, extra time together, real conversations. But how much would she risk? Her parents' approval? Her reputation? Her future prospects?

Danny wanted to believe she'd choose him. But believing and knowing were different things.

He thought about Thursday—the almost-kiss interrupted by those beachgoers. If they hadn't been interrupted, if he'd actually kissed her, would that have changed anything? Or would it have just complicated everything further?

The Fourth of July race was two weeks away. After that, the tutoring would be done. He'd pass or fail his algebra exam, be eligible for the race or not. Either way, the excuse for regular meetings would evaporate.

Would Betty Ann want to keep seeing him then? Or had Snake been right—was this just a summer rebellion that would end when real life resumed?

Danny worked until the sun set and the garage grew too dark to see properly. His hands were stained with grease, his back ached from bending over the engine, and his heart felt heavy with questions he couldn't answer.

Inside, his family was gathered around the small table for dinner. His mother had made pasta—cheap, filling, one of their staples. Sarah, his ten-year-old sister, chattered about a horse she'd seen at the community center. Marco, eight, demonstrated a baseball swing with his fork until their mother told him to stop.

Tommy caught Danny's eye across the table and gave him a small, encouraging nod.

This was Danny's world. This kitchen, this family, these responsibilities. Could Betty Ann really fit into it? Would she even want to try?

He didn't know.

But Tuesday was coming, and he'd see her then. Maybe he could find the courage to ask the questions that mattered. Maybe she'd give him answers that eased the doubt.

Or maybe Snake was right, and Danny was heading for heartbreak.

Either way, he was in too deep to back out now.

For better or worse, he'd fallen for Betty Ann Morrison. And he'd just have to see where that fall landed him.
