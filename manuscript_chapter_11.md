# Chapter 11: Sandy's Warning

Saturday afternoon found me perched on a red vinyl stool at Coral Bay Soda Fountain, waiting for Sandy and trying not to think about Thursday's almost-kiss on the beach. Trying and failing spectacularly.

The soda fountain was classic 1950s charm incarnate: chrome fixtures gleaming under fluorescent lights, black and white checkerboard floor tiles, a long counter with a dozen spinning stools, and the jukebox in the corner currently playing "Que Sera, Sera" by Doris Day. The air smelled like vanilla and cherry syrup and grilled cheese sandwiches. This was our place—Sandy's and mine—had been since freshman year.

"Sorry I'm late!" Sandy burst through the door in a flurry of blonde curls and pink gingham, sliding onto the stool beside me. "My mother wanted help reorganizing the linen closet and you know how she gets about folding fitted sheets properly."

I laughed, grateful for her normalcy. "It's fine. I just got here."

Mr. Peterson, the owner, ambled over with his order pad. "The usual, girls?"

"Two cherry Cokes, please," Sandy said, then added, "and can we get a basket of fries to share?"

As Mr. Peterson headed behind the counter, Sandy turned to me with her full attention—which, with Sandy, was considerable. She had the kind of focus that made you feel like the most important person in the world and also like you couldn't hide a single secret.

"Okay, spill," she said immediately. "What's going on with you?"

"What do you mean?" I tried for innocent and probably landed somewhere near guilty.

"Betty Ann Morrison, I've known you since we were six years old. I know when something's different." She ticked points off on her fingers. "You've barely been around for two weeks. You cancelled our shopping trip last Saturday. You didn't come to youth group on Wednesday. And right now you're..." She waved her hand at me vaguely. "Glowing. You're glowing and distracted and you've been doodling on that napkin for five minutes without realizing it."

I looked down. Sure enough, I'd been sketching without conscious thought—the curve of the beach, palm fronds, the outline of a motorcycle. I crumpled the napkin quickly.

"I've just been busy," I said. "The tutoring is taking up a lot of time."

"Uh huh." Sandy's tone said she wasn't buying it for a second. "And how is the tutoring going? With Danny Cole?"

Just hearing his name made warmth bloom in my chest. I tried to keep my face neutral, but Sandy's eyes widened.

"Oh my gosh," she breathed. "Something happened. Something big happened. Tell me everything right now."

Mr. Peterson delivered our cherry Cokes with perfect timing, giving me a moment to collect my thoughts. I took a long sip, the sweet fizz buying me time.

"The tutoring is going really well," I said carefully. "Danny's making excellent progress. He'll definitely pass his exam."

"And?"

"And... we talk. A lot. Between problems, we just talk. About real things. About dreams and fears and what we actually want from life." The words came faster now, spilling out. "He's not what everyone thinks, Sandy. He's smart and hardworking and so loyal to his family. He works nights at the marina to support his mom and three younger siblings. He's practically raised them since his father died."

Sandy listened, her expression shifting from curiosity to something more careful. "You like him."

It wasn't a question, but I answered anyway. "Maybe. I don't know. Yes."

"Like, like him like him?"

I thought about Danny's hand brushing sand from mine, fingers lingering. About the way he'd leaned closer, clearly intending to kiss me before those voices interrupted. About how I'd wanted him to.

"Yes," I admitted quietly. "I like him like him."

Sandy was quiet for a long moment. Then she reached over and took my hand. "Betty Ann, I need you to listen to me as your friend, okay? I'm not trying to be mean. I'm trying to be honest."

Dread curled in my stomach. "Okay."

"Danny Cole has a reputation. You know he does." Sandy's voice was gentle but firm. "He's been in fights. Multiple fights. He races illegally out on the highway. He runs with a rough crowd—you know Snake Brennan and those guys. They're not... they're not like us."

"Danny's not like that—"

"Let me finish," Sandy interrupted kindly. "I've heard things, Betty Ann. From girls at school. He's dated around, especially with girls from the south side. There's talk that he's..." She chose her words carefully. "Experienced. That he knows how to charm girls and then moves on."

The words hit like little arrows, each one finding a soft spot. "You don't know him."

"Neither do you, really. You've known him, what, three weeks? Four?" Sandy squeezed my hand. "I'm not saying he's a bad person. I'm saying you need to be careful. What if he's just being nice because you're helping him pass? What if once he gets what he needs—the algebra help, the passing grade—he goes back to his own world and you're left having risked everything for nothing?"

"He's not like that," I said again, but doubt crept in despite my certainty. What if Sandy was right? What if I was just the convenient good girl who could help him academically?

"And even if he's being completely sincere," Sandy continued, "think about the practical side. Your parents will never accept him. You know they won't. Your father already doesn't want you tutoring him. What happens when he finds out it's more than that?"

"He won't—"

"He will. Coral Bay is too small for secrets. Someone will see you together and talk. Mrs. Patterson or Mrs. Jenkins or someone from church. And then what?" Sandy's worry was genuine, written all over her face. "Your reputation will be damaged, Betty Ann. Colleges look at that kind of thing. Your whole future could be affected by association with someone like Danny Cole."

"Someone like him," I repeated, hearing the judgment in the phrase.

"You know what I mean. I'm not trying to be snobbish, I'm being realistic." Sandy's eyes filled with sympathetic tears. "I'm scared for you. I'm scared you're going to throw away everything you've worked for—your perfect record, your college prospects, your parents' trust—for a boy who probably won't stick around."

"You're wrong about him," I said, pulling my hand back. "Danny's not using me. He's not going to disappear. You don't know what he's really like."

"And you do? After three weeks of beach tutoring?"

"Yes." But even as I said it, uncertainty gnawed at me. How well did I really know him? We'd shared some honest conversations, yes. We'd opened up to each other, shown vulnerable parts. But Sandy's words planted seeds of doubt in soil that was already uncertain.

The fries arrived, but neither of us reached for them.

"I don't want to fight with you," Sandy said softly. "I love you. You're my best friend. I just... I don't want to see you get hurt. And I really don't want to see you throw your life away for someone who might not be worth it."

"Danny is worth it," I said, but my voice wavered slightly.

Sandy heard the waver. Her expression softened into something like pity. "Betty Ann. Honey. You're falling for him. It's obvious in how you talk about him, how you defend him, how you've been acting. I just need you to ask yourself: are you ready to risk everything—your parents' trust, your reputation, your future—for a boy you barely know? Because that's what's going to happen if you keep going down this path."

I didn't have an answer. Couldn't find words past the tightness in my throat.

Sandy took a deep breath. "I'm not saying stop tutoring him. But maybe... keep it professional? Don't let it become more than it should be. Protect yourself."

"I should go," I said abruptly, standing. "I told my mother I'd be home by four."

"Betty Ann—"

"It's fine. I'm fine." I wasn't fine. I needed air, needed space to think. "I'll call you this week."

I left money on the counter for my untouched Coke and headed for the door. Behind me, Sandy called my name, but I kept walking.

Outside, the afternoon heat hit me like a wall. I walked without direction, letting my feet carry me through familiar streets while my mind spun.

Sandy was trying to help. I knew that. She was my best friend, looking out for me. Everything she'd said came from a place of genuine concern.

But she was also wrong. She had to be wrong.

Except... what if she wasn't?

I barely knew Danny, not really. Three weeks of tutoring twice a week—that was twelve sessions, maybe twenty-four hours total time together. Could you really know someone in twenty-four hours?

I thought about the marina district girls I'd seen that day at his garage. Girls in tight sweaters and confident smiles, girls who looked like they belonged in Danny's world. Girls who probably didn't spend their weekends at church youth group or working in their father's hardware store.

I was Betty Ann Morrison, honor roll student, good daughter, girl who'd never broken a rule until three weeks ago. What was I doing thinking I could fit into Danny Cole's life?

What if he was just being kind because I was helping him? What if once he passed algebra and could race in the Fourth of July competition, he'd thank me politely and disappear back into his own world where I didn't fit?

The doubt sat heavy in my chest like a stone.

I thought about Sandy's warnings: reputation, college applications, parental trust. Everything I'd worked for. Everything I was supposed to want. Was I really ready to risk all of that for feelings that might not be reciprocated?

And what about Danny's feelings? He'd almost kissed me Thursday. Almost. But maybe that didn't mean what I thought it meant. Maybe he kissed lots of girls. Maybe I was reading too much into shared conversations and lingering touches.

Maybe I was just the convenient good girl who was useful right now.

The thought made my stomach turn.

By the time I reached home, I'd worked myself into a spiral of doubt. My carefully constructed certainty from Thursday—the belief that what Danny and I had was real and worth fighting for—had cracked under Sandy's gentle warnings.

At dinner, I pushed pot roast around my plate while my parents discussed the hardware store's quarterly inventory. I heard my father's voice but not his words, too busy replaying every interaction with Danny, searching for signs that Sandy might be right.

Had he ever actually said he wanted more than tutoring? Or had I projected that onto him?

When he'd touched my hand, held my gaze, leaned in to kiss me—had that been genuine attraction or just a moment that would have happened with anyone sitting beside him on that beach?

I didn't know. Suddenly, I didn't know anything.

"Betty Ann?" My mother's voice pulled me back. "You're very quiet tonight. Is everything all right?"

"Just tired," I said, which wasn't quite a lie. I was exhausted—emotionally wrung out from Sandy's warnings and my own spiraling thoughts.

"The tutoring is going well?" my father asked, his tone suggesting it better be going well given how much time I was spending on it.

"Very well. Danny's making excellent progress."

My father grunted, unimpressed. "Good. Sooner he passes that test, sooner you can stop spending time with that boy."

The words stung more than they should have. Because what if my father was right? What if Danny passing his test meant the end of our time together? What if I'd built something in my head that didn't actually exist?

That night, lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and tried to sort through my confusion. Part of me wanted to trust what I'd felt on that beach Thursday—the connection, the certainty, the rightness of Danny's almost-touch. Part of me whispered that Sandy's warnings came from a place of wisdom and protective friendship.

I pulled out my diary, intending to write through my feelings. But I couldn't find the words. Instead, I drew Danny's face from memory—the concentration in his eyes when he worked through problems, the way his mouth quirked when he was about to make a joke, the softness in his expression when he talked about his siblings.

Did he look at me like that? Or had I imagined the warmth in his gaze?

Tuesday's tutoring session suddenly felt loaded with questions I didn't know how to ask. How did Danny really see me? Was I his tutor or something more? And if I was something more, was I ready for what that meant?

Sandy's voice echoed in my mind: *Are you ready to risk everything for a boy you barely know?*

I didn't know.

God help me, I didn't know.

But Tuesday was coming whether I had answers or not. And I'd have to face Danny with all these doubts churning inside me, trying to figure out what was real and what I'd only hoped was real.

The uncertainty was exhausting.

I fell asleep with the sketch of Danny's face still in my lap, his pencil-drawn eyes looking at me with an expression I couldn't quite read—just like in real life.
