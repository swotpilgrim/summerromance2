# Chapter 16: The Test

Monday morning I woke with Danny on my mind, which wasn't unusual anymore. What was unusual was the sharp anxiety twisting my stomach. Today was his algebra final exam. Everything we'd worked toward for the past six weeks came down to this one test.

I worked my shift at Morrison's Hardware in a fog of nervous energy. Every customer seemed to move in slow motion. The clock hands barely crawled forward. My father noticed my distraction and asked sharply if I was feeling ill. I claimed a headache and tried to focus.

But all I could think about was Danny sitting in Mrs. Henderson's classroom, pencil in hand, facing problems that would determine whether he could race in the Fourth of July competition just

 three weeks away. Whether he'd be expelled or given another chance. Whether all our secret beach sessions had been enough.

At lunch I couldn't eat. My mother's tuna sandwich sat untouched while I picked at the crust and thought about carburetor ratios and quadratic equations. Had I explained things clearly enough? Had Danny retained the information under test pressure? What if exhaustion caught up with him—he'd worked a double shift Friday night.

"Betty Ann, you're very pale," my mother observed. "Perhaps you should lie down this afternoon."

"I'm fine." Just worried about someone I'm forbidden to see taking a test that will determine his future. "Just a headache."

The afternoon crawled by with excruciating slowness. Three o'clock. Four o'clock. The test would be done by now. Danny would be walking out, either confident or devastated, and I had no way to know which.

I thought about calling the school—absurd. About stopping by Mrs. Henderson's classroom—impossible with my father watching me like a hawk. About anything that would end this terrible not-knowing.

At five o'clock, I helped close the store, counting the register with shaking hands. My father locked the front door and I followed him to his truck for the short drive home.

"You seem anxious," he observed.

"Just the headache."

His eyes narrowed slightly. "Nothing to do with that Cole boy's algebra exam being today?"

My blood ran cold. "How did you know about that?"

"Mrs. Henderson mentioned it at church yesterday. Said she hoped he'd retained what you taught him." His tone was neutral but watchful. "I assume that means your tutoring will be concluded soon."

"I suppose so." If Danny passed. If he didn't get expelled. If I ever got to see him again to find out.

At dinner, I pushed food around my plate while my parents discussed inventory orders and the church picnic. I heard their voices without processing words, too busy imagining scenarios. Danny triumphant. Danny crushed. Danny never wanting to see me again because I'd failed him.

"May I be excused?" I asked abruptly. "My headache is worse."

My mother felt my forehead. "You do feel warm. Yes, go rest."

In my room, I paced. Pulled out my sketchbook and couldn't draw. Tried to read and couldn't focus. The waiting was torture.

Tuesday arrived with no relief. Our library session was scheduled for two o'clock, but Danny wouldn't know his results yet. Mrs. Henderson needed time to grade all the exams.

I arrived at the library early, too anxious to stay home. Danny showed up precisely at two, his face tense and unreadable. Mrs. Kowalski watched us settle at our table with her usual disapproval.

"How did it go?" I whispered the moment she turned away.

"I don't know." Danny's voice was low. "Some problems were straightforward—the ones we practiced. Others were..." He shrugged, trying for casual and not quite managing it. "Tricky. I did my best."

"I'm sure you did great."

"Maybe." But doubt shadowed his eyes. "Or maybe I failed again and this was all for nothing."

"It wasn't for nothing," I said fiercely, forgetting to whisper. Mrs. Kowalski glared at us. I lowered my voice. "Even if—which won't happen—but even if you didn't pass, what we learned about each other wasn't for nothing."

Danny's expression softened. "No. That part wasn't for nothing."

We worked through practice problems neither of us cared about anymore. The test was done; studying now was pointless. But we needed the excuse to sit together, to exist in the same space, even with Mrs. Kowalski's vigilant presence.

Wednesday crawled by in similar agony. Thursday I told my mother I needed to go to the library—not a complete lie, I did go there first. But afterward, I slipped away to Palmetto Beach, hoping Danny might have the same idea.

He was there, sitting on the sand without our blanket, staring at the water. My heart squeezed at the dejection in his posture.

"Hey," I said, dropping beside him.

"Hey." He didn't look at me. "I shouldn't be here. If your father found out—"

"I don't care." I took his hand. "Have you heard anything?"

"Nothing. Mrs. Henderson said she'd post results Friday. Two more days of not knowing if I screwed up my last chance."

"You didn't screw up."

"You don't know that."

"I know you worked harder than anyone I've ever seen. I know you understood the concepts. I know you're smarter than you give yourself credit for." I squeezed his hand. "I believe in you, even if you don't believe in yourself right now."

Danny finally looked at me, and the vulnerability in his expression made my chest ache. "What if I let you down?"

"You couldn't." The certainty in my voice surprised both of us. "Passing or failing doesn't change who you are. It doesn't change how I see you."

"It changes whether I can race. Whether I get expelled. Whether any of this meant anything."

"It meant something regardless of a test score." I shifted to face him fully. "Danny, you learned algebra. You showed up exhausted from night shifts and learned anyway. That's not nothing. That's incredible."

He was quiet for a long moment. Then he pulled me into a hug—brief, desperate, holding on. I wrapped my arms around him and wished I could absorb some of his worry.

"Friday," he said into my hair. "One way or another, we'll know Friday."

"We'll face it together. Whatever it is."

We sat on the beach until I had to leave to maintain my alibi. Danny walked me part of the way back, and at the corner where we'd part, he caught my hand.

"Thank you," he said. "For believing. Even when it's hard."

"Always," I promised. "I'll always believe in you."

Friday afternoon arrived like a slow-motion car crash. I'd told my mother I needed to return books to the library—true, if misleading about my real motivation.

I arrived at Coral Bay High School at 2:45, my stomach a knot of anxiety. Mrs. Henderson had said she'd meet with students individually starting at three o'clock. I lurked near her classroom, trying to look like I had legitimate business here.

Danny arrived at 2:55, surprised to see me. "Betty Ann? What are you—"

"I needed to know," I said simply. "I couldn't wait until next week to find out."

"Your father—"

"Isn't here." I took Danny's hand. "We're facing this together, remember?"

At three o'clock precisely, Mrs. Henderson opened her classroom door. She saw both of us and something like satisfaction crossed her face.

"Miss Morrison. Mr. Cole. Please, come in."

We followed her inside. The classroom smelled like chalk and summer dust. Mrs. Henderson sat at her desk, two exam papers face-down in front of her.

She let us sweat for a moment, her expression unreadable. Then she smiled.

"Mr. Cole, I'm pleased to inform you that you passed your algebra final with a grade of B-minus."

The relief was so intense my knees went weak. Beside me, Danny had gone completely still, like he couldn't quite process the words.

"I... passed?" His voice cracked slightly.

"You passed." Mrs. Henderson's smile widened. "Not just barely—you demonstrated genuine understanding of the concepts. Several of your solutions showed creative problem-solving that impressed me."

"I can race?" Danny asked, as if he needed confirmation of what this meant.

"You're eligible for the Fourth of July competition. You won't be expelled. You'll move forward to senior year." Mrs. Henderson looked between us. "Thanks in large part to Miss Morrison's excellent tutoring."

"Betty Ann did everything," Danny said immediately. "She's the one who figured out how to explain things so they made sense. She's the one who—"

"You did the work, Mr. Cole," Mrs. Henderson interrupted gently. "Miss Morrison provided the tools, but you built the understanding. Give yourself credit for that."

I watched emotions play across Danny's face—disbelief, relief, joy, gratitude. My own eyes burned with proud tears.

"There is one thing I'd like to say," Mrs. Henderson continued, her tone shifting to something more careful. "I assigned this tutoring arrangement because I believed you could both benefit from it. Miss Morrison needed to learn how to teach from a student's perspective. Mr. Cole needed someone who believed in his capability. I'm gratified that the academic goals were met."

She paused meaningfully, looking between us with knowing eyes.

"I'm also aware that tutoring relationships can sometimes develop into... more complex connections. I trust that both of you will navigate any such complications with maturity and careful consideration of the consequences."

It wasn't quite an endorsement. But it wasn't disapproval either. It was acknowledgment that she saw us, understood what was developing, and trusted us to handle it responsibly.

"Thank you, Mrs. Henderson," I managed. "For everything."

"Yes, thank you," Danny echoed, still looking slightly dazed.

"You're both welcome. Now, I believe you have celebrating to do." Mrs. Henderson stood, signaling the meeting was over. "Just remember—celebration should be appropriate for students your age."

We left her classroom in a bubble of euphoric disbelief. In the empty hallway, Danny turned to me, grinning wider than I'd ever seen.

"I passed."

"You passed!" I threw my arms around him, not caring about propriety. "Danny, you did it!"

He lifted me off the ground, spinning once before setting me down, both of us laughing. "I can race! The Fourth of July championship—I'm eligible! I won't be expelled!"

"I'm so proud of you."

"I couldn't have done it without you." His hands framed my face, thumbs brushing my cheekbones. "Betty Ann, you changed everything."

"You did the work—"

"You believed in me when no one else did. You saw past the reputation and the failures. You made me believe I could do it." His voice went rough with emotion. "I don't know how to thank you."

"You don't need to thank me. I'm just... I'm so happy for you."

We stood there in the school hallway, lost in the moment, until the sound of approaching footsteps reminded us where we were. We separated quickly, trying for appropriate distance.

"We should celebrate," Danny said, still grinning. "Properly. Let me take you to the malt shop—just for a little while. I promise to have you home before your parents notice."

My heart said yes immediately, but practicality intruded. "Danny, we'd be seen. Everyone would talk."

"I know. I just..." He looked at me with such open joy. "I want to celebrate with you. The person who made this possible."

I thought about the risks. About my father's rules and my grounded status. About reputation and consequences.

Then I thought about Danny's face, alight with success for probably the first time in years. About how hard he'd worked. About how much this meant.

"Okay," I heard myself say. "Half an hour at the malt shop. Then I have to get home."

"Thirty minutes," Danny agreed. "That's all I'm asking."

We walked to the Coral Bay Malt Shop together, Danny practically bouncing with energy. He opened the door for me and I walked through, heart pounding at what we were doing—being seen together publicly, defying my father's rules, choosing celebration over obedience.

The malt shop was fairly empty, just a few teenagers at booths and Mr. Peterson behind the counter. Danny ordered two chocolate malts and we slid into a booth, facing each other across the Formica table.

"To passing algebra," Danny said, raising his glass.

"To proving everyone wrong," I countered, touching my glass to his.

The malts were sweet and cold and perfect. Danny talked about the race, about his plans for final tune-ups on his car, about the prize money that would help his family. I watched him glow with possibility and felt my heart swell.

This was worth it. Whatever consequences came, this moment was worth it.

Through the window, I saw a few people walk by. Mrs. Patterson among them. She paused, clearly seeing us, her expression sharpening with interest. My stomach dropped, but I forced myself not to react.

"Betty Ann?" Danny had noticed my attention shift. "What's wrong?"

"Nothing." I looked back at him, choosing the moment over the fear. "Tell me more about the race."

We stayed for twenty-eight minutes. Danny held my hand across the table openly, not caring who saw. People stared—some with judgment, some with curiosity, some with something like approval. Let them stare.

When we left, Danny walked me partway home. At the corner where we'd part, he caught both my hands.

"Thank you," he said again. "Not just for the tutoring. For being you. For seeing me. For not caring what people think."

"I care what people think," I admitted. "I'm just deciding you matter more."

His smile could have lit the whole sky. "Same."

We parted ways and I walked home feeling weightless. Danny had passed. He could race. We'd celebrated together, publicly, consequences be damned.

Whatever happened next, we'd have this. This moment of pure triumph and joy and choosing each other.

For now, that was enough.
