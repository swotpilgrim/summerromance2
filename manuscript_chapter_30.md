# Chapter 30: Summer's Promise

One year later, I sat on the familiar beach blanket at Palmetto Beach, sketchbook balanced on my knees, waiting for Danny to arrive. August heat shimmered off the sand, but the breeze from the ocean kept it bearable.

So much had changed in twelve months. I'd completed my first year at Atlanta College of Art, thriving in classes that let me create without apology. Danny had graduated from Coral Bay High—walking across that stage in cap and gown with his whole family cheering. He'd saved nearly three thousand dollars working double shifts at the marina.

And next week, he was moving to Atlanta.

The motorcycle engine announced his arrival. I looked up to see Danny parking at the edge of the lot, pulling off his helmet. He was nineteen now, twenty in November. Still working-class, still from the marina district, but carrying himself with confidence earned through proving everyone wrong.

He walked across the sand toward me, grinning. In his hand, he carried a folder.

"What's that?" I asked as he dropped onto the blanket beside me.

"This," he said, opening the folder with barely contained excitement, "is the lease agreement for a garage space in Atlanta. Eight hundred square feet on the south side, reasonable rent, zoned for automotive work."

I stared at the papers, then at him. "You found a location?"

"I found a location. Signed the lease this morning." His grin was incandescent. "Cole Custom Garage opens September first."

I threw my arms around him, laughing. "Danny, that's amazing!"

"It gets better." He pulled back to meet my eyes. "I also signed a lease on an apartment. Small, one bedroom, not fancy. But it's ten minutes from your campus and fifteen from the garage."

"You're really moving to Atlanta."

"I'm really moving to Atlanta." He tucked a strand of hair behind my ear. "We've done long distance for a year. It's been hard. I'm done with hard. I want to actually be with you."

"What about your family?"

"My mom is dating again—a good guy who works at the hardware store, actually. Sarah's in middle school and doing well. Tommy's talking about community college. Marco's on a real baseball team now." Danny's expression was soft. "They're okay, Betty Ann. It's okay for me to build my own life now."

"Your father would be proud," I said quietly. "Of how you took care of them. Of what you're building now."

"I hope so." He looked out at the waves. "I'm terrified this won't work. That I'll fail at the garage, waste all my savings, prove your father right about me having no prospects."

"You won't fail."

"You don't know that."

"I do." I took his hand. "Because I've watched you work toward this for two years. I've seen your determination, your skill, your ability to turn nothing into something beautiful. You built a cherry red hot rod from a wreck. You'll build this garage the same way."

He kissed my knuckles gently. "What did I do to deserve you?"

"You saw me. Really saw me, when everyone else saw what they expected to see." I leaned into his shoulder. "You helped me be brave enough to choose my own path."

"We chose each other's paths. Together."

"Together," I agreed.

We sat watching the waves for a while, comfortable in the silence. This beach had witnessed so much of our story—first awkward tutoring sessions, secret meetings, declarations of love. Now it was witnessing this: the beginning of building something permanent.

"Your father approved the Atlanta move," Danny said eventually. "I asked his permission before signing the lease."

I sat up, surprised. "You did?"

"I'm courting his daughter properly. That means asking permission for big decisions." Danny smiled slightly. "He said, and I quote, 'I still think you're going to break her heart, but at least you're stubborn enough to try making it work.'"

I laughed. "That's practically a blessing from Walter Morrison."

"I'll take it." Danny pulled me close again. "One more year of art school for you. One year of building the garage for me. Then..."

"Then what?"

"Then I'm going to ask your father for permission to marry you. Properly this time, with a ring and a stable business and proof that I can take care of you."

My heart stuttered. "Marry me?"

"If you'll have me. If you haven't gotten tired of me by then. If—"

I kissed him, cutting off the doubts. When I pulled back, we were both grinning.

"Yes," I said. "Whenever you ask. The answer is yes."

"Even though I'll probably always smell like motor oil?"

"Even though."

"Even though your father will never think I'm good enough for you?"

"He'll come around eventually. But even if he doesn't, yes."

"Even though we'll probably struggle financially for the first few years?"

"We've faced harder things." I touched his face gently. "Danny, I chose you when it cost me everything. I'll choose you again when it costs nothing. And every day in between."

His eyes went bright. "I love you, Betty Ann Morrison. Have since you brought those first sandwiches and pretended you'd made too many."

"I love you, Danny Cole. Have since you showed up on time with careful notes and made me see past my own assumptions."

We kissed again, soft and sweet and full of promise. The summer sun painted everything golden, the waves provided their endless soundtrack, and the future spread before us—uncertain but ours.

"Thank you," Danny said quietly.

"For what?"

"For being brave enough to climb out windows for me. For defying your father. For choosing me when it would have been easier to choose safe." He pulled me close. "For seeing me."

"Thank you for being worth the risk. For staying when you wanted to run. For proving everyone wrong about who you could become."

We sat together on the blanket, the same one where I'd first tried to teach him algebra using car metaphors. Where we'd grown from strangers to friends to something deeper. Where we'd made choices that changed everything.

The summer was ending. In two weeks, we'd both be in Atlanta—me returning to art school, Danny starting his garage. We'd build lives there, together and separately. We'd struggle and work and slowly prove that loving each other wasn't a mistake.

But all of that was future. Right now, in this moment, we had this beach and this blanket and each other.

"Race you to the water?" Danny suggested suddenly.

"You're on."

We ran laughing to the ocean, splashing in like teenagers instead of adults on the edge of building real lives. The water was warm, the sun was bright, and everything was possible.

I'd been the good daughter once. Perfect, obedient, never disappointing anyone.

Now I was just Betty Ann—messy and brave and choosing my own path. I was an art student and a rule-breaker and deeply in love with a boy from the wrong side of town who'd taught me what courage looked like.

And I wouldn't change a single choice that brought me here.

"Hey Betty Ann?" Danny called from waist-deep water.

"Yeah?"

"Thank you for that first sandwich."

I laughed, the sound carrying across the waves. "Thank you for being worth every consequence."

"Worth it?"

"Every single one."

We swam and laughed and existed in that perfect moment, the summer of the hot rod king fading into the summer of building something lasting.

Together.

Always together.
