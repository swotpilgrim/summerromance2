# Chapter 28: Father's Arrival

Two weeks of grounding passed with agonizing slowness. I worked at the hardware store, came straight home, stayed in my room. But this time felt different from before—there was hope at the end. A real future instead of endless punishment.

Sandy visited twice under supervision. Through her, I got word to Danny about my father's conditions. He sent back messages through the network: he understood, he'd follow every rule, he'd prove himself.

Mrs. Henderson stopped by the hardware store one afternoon, ostensibly to buy paint but really to check on me. "Your father called to thank me for providing context," she said quietly. "I told him what I told you—Danny Cole works harder than most students when given proper support."

"Thank you. For everything."

"Just prove me right, Miss Morrison. Both of you."

Finally, two Sundays after the sock hop, the day arrived. Danny was coming for dinner. My mother had spent all morning cooking pot roast with all the fixings, her good china set on the table. My father had been tense and silent all day.

I was a nervous wreck.

At five o'clock precisely, a knock came at the door. I started to answer it but my father waved me back. "I'll get it."

He opened the door to reveal Danny standing on the porch in slacks and a button-down shirt—borrowed from Rico, I'd later learn—his hair neatly combed. He looked terrified but determined.

"Mr. Morrison." Danny's voice was steady. "Thank you for agreeing to see me."

"Mr. Cole. Come in."

Danny entered our living room, taking in the neat furnishings, the family photos on the mantle, the comfortable middle-class respectability. He looked painfully out of place but held his head high.

"Sir, before we go any further, I want to apologize," Danny started. "For the trouble I've caused your family. For the situations Betty Ann was put in because of me. That was never my intention, but it happened, and I take full responsibility."

My father's expression didn't soften. "Go on."

"I also want to assure you that I intend to prove myself worthy of courting your daughter. I'll follow every rule you set. I'll have her home on time every time. I'll treat her with complete respect." Danny paused. "I know you don't think much of me. I understand why. But I'm asking for the chance to show you I'm more than my reputation."

"That's a pretty speech," my father said. "But talk is cheap, Mr. Cole. Actions matter."

"Yes, sir. Which is why I'm here. To demonstrate through actions that I'm serious about Betty Ann and about making something of myself."

My mother appeared from the kitchen, wiping her hands on her apron. "Dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. Why don't we all sit down?"

We settled into the living room—Danny and I on the sofa, my parents in facing chairs. The arrangement felt like an interrogation.

"Tell me about your family," my father began.

Danny answered honestly about his mother, his siblings, his father's death. About working at the marina to support them, about the sacrifices required. His voice was steady, not asking for pity but stating facts.

"And your plans after high school?" my father pressed.

"I'm committed to finishing senior year properly this time. Passing all my classes, graduating with my class." Danny glanced at me briefly. "Mrs. Henderson has agreed to tutor me if I struggle. After graduation, I plan to save money toward opening my own garage. Doing custom work, restorations. I'm good with engines, sir. I have real skill there."

"Lots of people have skill. Not everyone makes a business out of it."

"No, sir. But I'm willing to work harder than most people to make it happen. The same way I worked to pass algebra. The same way I work two jobs now."

The interrogation continued through dinner. My father asked about everything—Danny's grades, his work history, his future goals, his intentions toward me. Danny answered every question honestly, not deflecting or making excuses.

I watched my father's expression slowly shift from outright hostility to grudging consideration. He clearly wasn't convinced Danny was good enough for me. But he was acknowledging that Danny was trying.

"You understand the rules?" my father asked over dessert. "Curfews. Supervision. Respect."

"Yes, sir. Completely."

"And you understand that if you break any rule—even once—you're done?"

"Yes, sir."

My father studied Danny for a long moment. Then he turned to me. "Betty Ann, do you have anything to say?"

"Just that I appreciate you giving us this chance," I said. "And that I promise to follow the rules too. No more climbing out windows."

"You better not." But there was almost warmth in his tone. "All right. Mr. Cole, you may court my daughter. Under the conditions discussed. We'll start with supervised dates—here at the house, at church events, at appropriate public venues. Curfew is nine PM on weeknights, ten PM on weekends. Understood?"

"Yes, sir. Thank you, sir."

After dinner, my parents allowed Danny and me to sit on the porch—visible through the window but with some privacy. We sat on the swing, careful distance between us, both hardly believing this was real.

"That was terrifying," Danny admitted.

"You were perfect." I wanted to take his hand but knew my father was watching. "He didn't throw you out. That's huge."

"The bar is very low."

"With my father, it really is." I smiled. "But Danny, we did it. We actually have permission now."

"With a million conditions."

"But permission." I finally dared to take his hand, knowing my father could see but not caring. "We can do this properly now. No more sneaking. No more lies."

"I'm going to prove him wrong," Danny said quietly. "About me. About us. I'm going to show him I can be someone worthy of you."

"You already are—"

"Let me earn it anyway." He squeezed my hand. "I'm going to finish school. Graduate. Save money. Build something real. And in a year or two, when I have something to offer beyond hope and determination, I'm going to come back to this house and ask your father properly for permission to marry you."

My breath caught. "Marry me?"

"Eventually. If you'll have me. If I haven't screwed it all up by then." His smile was nervous. "Too much? Too soon? I know we're only seventeen and nineteen—"

"No. Not too much. Not too soon." I squeezed his hand back. "Just... unexpected."

"I love you, Betty Ann Morrison. I'm in this for the long term. Just so you know."

"I love you too. And I'm in this for the long term too."

We sat on the porch swing, hands linked, talking quietly about the future. About his senior year starting in six weeks. About my art school applications. About letters we'd write if I ended up in Atlanta and he stayed in Coral Bay. About visiting on weekends and holidays.

About building a life together, slowly and properly and honestly.

Through the window, I saw my father watching. His expression was still skeptical, still worried. But he wasn't intervening. Wasn't separating us. Was giving us the chance he'd promised.

It wasn't perfect. It wasn't easy. But it was real.

And that was everything.
