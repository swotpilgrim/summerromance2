# Chapter 18: Race Day

Saturday evening arrived with the kind of perfect Florida weather that made tourists pay ridiculous sums for beachfront hotels—warm but not sweltering, a breeze off the ocean carrying the scent of salt and possibility. I'd spent Friday night at Sandy's, maintaining the illusion of an innocent sleepover while my stomach churned with anticipation and dread.

Sandy had agreed to drive me to the race with extreme reluctance. Now, at five forty-five, we sat in her father's borrowed Ford, parked a quarter-mile from mile marker 15, both of us staring at the scene ahead.

The highway strip outside Coral Bay had been transformed. At least thirty cars lined both sides of the road—hot rods, custom jobs, souped-up Chevys and Fords in every color imaginable. Boys in leather jackets and white t-shirts clustered around engines, girls in tight sweaters and rolled jeans leaned against fenders, cigarette smoke drifted through the golden evening light. Music blasted from multiple car radios, a cacophony of Chuck Berry and Little Richard competing for dominance.

"Are you absolutely sure about this?" Sandy asked for the fourth time.

"I'm sure."

"Betty Ann, if your father finds out—"

"He'll find out eventually. Everything comes out in Coral Bay." I checked my reflection in the visor mirror—modest sundress, cardigan, hair pulled back. I looked exactly like what I was: a good girl from the right side of town about to enter a world she didn't belong in. "Thank you for driving me. You can leave if you want. I'll find a way home."

"I'm not leaving you here alone." Sandy's expression was torn between disapproval and loyalty. "But I'm staying in the car. I'm not being seen at this thing."

"Fair enough."

I got out of the Ford, leaving Sandy behind her steering wheel with a magazine for cover. The evening air was thick with gasoline fumes and burning rubber. As I walked toward the gathered crowd, I felt dozens of eyes turn to assess me. I didn't fit here—that much was obvious from their stares.

But then I saw Danny's cherry red Ford, pristine as always, and Danny himself bent over the open hood with Tommy beside him. My heart did that stupid flutter thing it always did when I saw him.

"Danny!" Tommy spotted me first, his face breaking into a grin. He elbowed his brother. "Look who came!"

Danny straightened and turned, and the expression on his face—pure joy mixed with disbelief—made every risk worth it. He crossed to me in three long strides.

"You came," he said, like he'd half-expected me to bail.

"I said I would."

"I know, but..." He glanced around at the crowd, clearly aware we were being watched. "You're actually here. At an illegal street race. Betty Ann Morrison."

"Apparently I'm full of surprises." I tried for confident and probably landed somewhere near terrified.

Danny's racing crew materialized from various cars. Rico was first, grinning widely. "Danny's tutor! Didn't think we'd see you here."

"Surprises all around," Frankie added, eyeing me with something between respect and amusement.

Then Snake Brennan appeared, and the temperature dropped ten degrees. He looked me up and down with undisguised disdain.

"Well, well. The church girl came to slum it with the delinquents." His voice dripped mockery. "Does daddy know where his princess is tonight?"

"Snake—" Danny's voice held warning.

"What? I'm just surprised little Miss Perfect would risk her reputation coming to something like this." Snake's grin was sharp as a knife. "Unless she's not as perfect as everyone thinks."

"Leave her alone," Danny said, stepping slightly between us.

"I'm just saying, man. You sure she's not just here for the thrill? Good girls love the bad boy experience until it gets too real." Snake turned his attention back to me. "You gonna hang around after tonight, sweetheart? Or is this a one-time walk on the wild side before you go back to your country club life?"

Heat burned in my cheeks—embarrassment and anger mixed. Before I could respond, Danny's hand found mine.

"She's here because I asked her. Because this matters to me and I wanted her to see it. You got a problem with that?"

Snake raised his hands in mock surrender. "No problem at all. Just making conversation." He shot me one more appraising look before turning back to his own car. "Good luck with the race, Danny boy. You're gonna need it."

Tommy tugged my hand. "Don't listen to Snake. He's always a jerk. Come on, I'll show you where to stand to get the best view."

I followed Tommy to a spot on the shoulder where other spectators had gathered—mostly girls and a few younger siblings. Tommy explained the race format: quarter-mile drag, four racers per heat, fastest times advance to finals.

"Danny's racing in heat three," Tommy said. "Against Snake and two others. Winner gets $500 and bragging rights until next race."

Five hundred dollars. I thought about Danny's shabby house, his mother's reduced hours, the bills piling up. This wasn't just sport—it was survival.

The first heat lined up. Four cars roared to the starting line, engines thundering. Someone dropped a flag and they exploded forward in a cloud of exhaust and burning rubber. The sound was deafening, the smell overwhelming. Around me, people cheered and shouted.

The second heat was equally intense. Then it was Danny's turn.

I watched him climb into his Ford, saw him through the windshield adjusting something, his face set with concentration. Beside him, Snake's Chevy growled aggressively. Two other racers I didn't know flanked them.

Tommy grabbed my hand. "This is it."

The four cars crept to the line. Engines revved, the sound vibrating in my chest. The flag holder raised his arm—

And dropped it.

The cars launched forward with explosive force. My heart leapt into my throat. Danny's Ford pulled ahead immediately, his modifications paying off. Snake's Chevy kept pace for the first hundred yards, then fell behind. Danny crossed the finish line two car lengths ahead of second place.

"YES!" Tommy jumped up and down. "He won! Betty Ann, he won!"

I was screaming too, I realized, shouting Danny's name along with the crowd. Joy flooded through me—he'd done it. He'd won his heat, qualified for finals.

Danny parked and climbed out, grinning widely. He found me in the crowd and something passed between us—triumph shared, a moment of pure victory. Then his crew surrounded him, pounding his back, congratulating him.

The finals lined up twenty minutes later. Danny against three others, including Snake who'd won his semi-final heat. This was for all the money, all the glory.

I stood with Tommy, both of us tense as the cars lined up. The flag dropped. They surged forward. For a terrifying moment, Snake pulled ahead. Then Danny's Ford found its power and screamed past, eating up the distance with mechanical perfection.

He won. Cleanly, definitively. Danny Cole won the Fourth of July hot rod championship.

The crowd erupted. I found myself running toward the finish line with Tommy, both of us laughing. Danny climbed out of his car, triumphant, and found me immediately. He pulled me into a hug that lifted me off my feet, spinning once before setting me down.

"You did it!" I couldn't stop smiling. "Danny, you won!"

"I won!" His joy was incandescent. "Betty Ann, I actually won!"

We were surrounded by people congratulating him, accepting the $500 prize money, basking in the moment. For those few minutes, everything was perfect.

Then Snake approached.

"Good race," he said, but his tone suggested the opposite. His eyes found me. "Guess your good luck charm worked. Though I gotta wonder what kind of luck she's bringing. The kind that gets a man in trouble, probably."

"Walk away, Snake," Danny warned.

"Or what?" Snake's voice rose,  drawing attention. "You gonna defend your little church girl's honor? She even worth defending, or is she just playing with you until she gets bored?"

"Shut your mouth."

"Why? Because the truth hurts?" Snake looked at me directly. "We all know you're slumming, sweetheart. Playing rebel for the summer before you go back to your safe little life. Does Danny know he's just your temporary bad boy phase? Does he know you'll drop him the second daddy finds out?"

"That's not—" I started, but Danny stepped between us.

"I said shut your mouth."

"Make me."

The first punch happened too fast to stop. Danny's fist connected with Snake's jaw with a sickening crack. Snake stumbled back, then came at Danny swinging. They crashed together, a tangle of fists and fury.

"Stop!" I screamed, but the crowd had circled, some cheering, some recording. Rico and Frankie tried to pull them apart, but the rage had been building too long.

Snake got in a hard hit that split Danny's lip. Blood bloomed bright against his mouth. Danny retaliated with a punch that dropped Snake to his knees. Other racers finally managed to separate them, holding both back as they still strained toward each other.

"This isn't over," Snake spat, blood from his nose running down his chin. "You're gonna regret this, Cole."

"I don't regret defending her," Danny shot back, wiping blood from his lip.

Through the chaos, a horrifying realization cut through everything else: headlights were approaching. A truck I recognized.

My father's truck.

"No," I whispered, blood draining from my face. "No no no."

But it was too late. Walter Morrison's truck pulled up to the scene—the illegal race, the fight, the crowd of exactly the kind of people he'd warned me against. And there I stood, in the middle of it all.

My father climbed out of the truck, his face carved from stone. Behind him, my mother emerged from the passenger side, hand over her mouth.

Someone had told. Someone had seen me and called my parents. And now the reckoning I'd known was coming had arrived.

Danny saw my father approaching and moved toward me instinctively, protective even bloody and bruised. The crowd parted, sensing drama more interesting than the race.

Walter Morrison took in the scene with a single sweeping look: his daughter at an illegal street race, standing near a boy with blood on his face who'd clearly just been fighting, surrounded by the kind of people he'd explicitly warned about.

"Get in the truck." His voice was deadly quiet. "Now."

"Dad, I can explain—"

"NOW."

I'd never heard that tone from him before. Not rage—something colder and more final. I looked at Danny, whose expression showed guilt and fury and helplessness all at once.

"Mr. Morrison—" Danny started.

"You stay away from my daughter." My father cut him off without even looking at him. "You've done enough damage."

"It's not his fault!" The words burst out of me. "I wanted to be here. I chose to come."

"That's exactly the problem." My father's eyes finally met mine, and the disappointment there cut deeper than anger would have. "Get in the truck, Betty Ann. We're going home."

I climbed into the truck bed, unable to meet anyone's eyes. As my father drove away from the scene, I looked back once. Danny stood in the golden evening light, blood on his face and $500 in his pocket and devastation in his eyes.

I'd crossed the line I couldn't uncross.

Now came the consequences.
