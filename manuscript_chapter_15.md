# Chapter 15: Secret Meetings

The Coral Bay Public Library smelled like old paper and furniture polish and Mrs. Kowalski's disapproval. Tuesday afternoon, I sat at our usual back table, algebra textbook open between Danny and me, Mrs. Kowalski watching from her circulation desk like a hawk guarding precious prey.

Danny had arrived precisely at two o'clock, surprise clear on his face when he saw we were back at the library. I'd managed to mouth "later" when Mrs. Kowalski wasn't looking. Now we worked through problems with painful formality, sitting across from each other instead of side by side, speaking in whispers that barely qualified as conversation.

"If X equals four," I said quietly, "then what does Y equal in this equation?"

Danny wrote out the work, solved correctly, showed me his answer. All proper. All supervised. All completely wrong for what we'd become.

When Mrs. Kowalski turned to help another patron, Danny leaned forward slightly. "What happened?"

"My father found out about the beach." I kept my eyes on the textbook, aware of Mrs. Kowalski's returning attention. "We're forbidden from meeting anywhere except here. I'm grounded for two weeks."

Danny's pencil stilled. "Betty Ann—"

"Just listen," I whispered urgently. "I can't talk long. But I'm not accepting this. My father doesn't get to decide who I see."

"If you're grounded—"

"I'll figure something out." I met his eyes briefly, trying to communicate everything I couldn't say aloud. "Thursday. Same place, same time. Can you be there?"

Danny looked torn between hope and concern. "Are you sure? If your father finds out—"

"He won't. I'll be careful." Mrs. Kowalski was approaching. I raised my voice to normal volume. "So you see how the quadratic formula applies here?"

"Yeah," Danny said, catching on. "That makes sense."

Mrs. Kowalski stopped beside our table. "Everything all right?"

"Fine," I said brightly. "Danny's doing really well with these concepts."

She lingered a moment longer, then retreated. Danny gathered his things, our hour of supervised time complete. At the door, he looked back. I nodded once—a promise. Thursday.

Thursday morning, I told my mother I was going to Sandy's house to work on a presentation for church youth group. The lie came easier than it should have, smooth and practiced.

"Will you be home for dinner?" my mother asked, not looking up from her needlepoint.

"By five-thirty," I promised.

"All right, dear. Say hello to Sandy for me."

I walked out of the house carrying my bag, guilt sitting heavy in my stomach. I'd never deliberately lied to my parents like this before. The good daughter didn't lie. The good daughter obeyed.

But the good daughter was suffocating.

I met Danny at Palmetto Beach at two o'clock, arriving breathless from walking fast and looking over my shoulder. My hands shook as I spread the beach blanket.

"You came," Danny said, dropping beside me. "I wasn't sure you would."

"I said I would."

"Your father—"

"Doesn't get to control every part of my life." I pulled out the textbooks, maintaining the appearance of studying in case anyone passed by. "I'm sorry we have to sneak around like this."

"I'm the one who should be sorry. This is all because of me." Danny's guilt was written across his face. "If I'd just—"

"Don't," I interrupted. "Don't apologize for existing. My father's prejudice isn't your fault."

We worked through algebra problems, but the session felt different now. Every moment felt stolen, precious. I found myself checking my watch constantly, aware of time ticking away, aware that I had to be home by five-thirty or risk discovery.

"I hate this," Danny said after a particularly rushed explanation. "I hate that you have to lie for us."

"I hate it too. But what's the alternative? Never see you? Let my father win?"

"Maybe he should win. Maybe this isn't worth—"

"Don't finish that sentence." I gripped his hand. "You're worth it. We're worth it. I just need time to figure out how to make my father see that."

But even as I said it, I knew it was unlikely. My father had made up his mind. Danny was trouble, inappropriate, unacceptable. No amount of algebra tutoring would change that.

The session ended too quickly. Danny walked me to where we'd need to part ways, his expression troubled.

"Be careful," he said. "Please."

"I will. Same time next Tuesday?"

He nodded, then pulled me close for a quick hug—brief, appropriate, but full of everything we couldn't say aloud. I walked away before I could do something foolish like stay longer, like risk discovery for a few more minutes together.

---

The lying became easier with practice, which scared me more than anything.

Tuesday: "Studying at Sandy's."
Thursday: "Volunteering to organize the church library."
The following Tuesday: "Meeting with Mrs. Henderson about helping with summer school."

Each lie slid out smoothly. My mother believed every one because I'd never given her reason not to trust me. The betrayal of that trust sat in my stomach like stones, but not enough to stop me.

At the beach, Danny and I snatched whatever time we could. Our conversations grew deeper, more urgent. We talked about futures—his dream garage, my art school aspirations. We wondered aloud if those futures could overlap, could include each other. The conversations were hypothetical but weighted with hope and growing certainty.

We grew bolder physically too. Danny held my hand openly now when we walked the beach. I let him tuck my hair behind my ear, his fingers lingering against my cheek. We sat closer, shoulders and knees touching, testing the boundaries of propriety.

One Thursday, after working through a particularly difficult set of problems, we sat watching the waves. Danny reached up and brushed a strand of hair from my face, his hand gentle against my temple. I turned into his touch instinctively.

"Betty Ann," he said softly, my name a question and a prayer.

"Yes?"

"Can I kiss you?"

My heart hammered against my ribs. "Yes." Then, reality crashing in: "But not here. What if someone sees?"

Danny pulled back, nodding understanding, but I saw the flash of hurt before he hid it. "You're right. I'm sorry."

"Don't be sorry. I want you to. I do. I just..." Fear choked the words. "If my father found out—"

"I know." Danny's voice was gentle. "It's okay. We have time."

But did we? Every day felt borrowed. Every meeting was a risk. How long could we sustain this before someone saw us, before I slipped up with a lie, before my father discovered my deception?

Walking home after these sessions, I felt split in two. Part of me felt liberated—I was making my own choices, following my heart, being brave enough to choose Danny despite the consequences. Part of me felt sick with guilt—I was lying to my parents daily, deceiving them, betraying their trust in ways I'd never imagined myself capable of.

At dinner, my father would ask about my day and I'd lie smoothly. "Productive afternoon at Sandy's." My mother would ask about youth group and I'd invent details about the library organization project that didn't exist. They believed me because they'd never had reason not to.

The ease of the deception terrified me.

Who was I becoming? The girl who lied to her parents? The girl who snuck around behind backs? The girl who broke rules without remorse?

But then I'd think about Danny's face when I arrived at the beach, the relief and joy there. I'd remember our conversations, the connection between us that felt more real than anything else in my carefully constructed life. I'd think about the future we were tentatively planning together.

And I'd lie again.

Two weeks into the secret meetings, I made a mistake.

I was supposed to be at a church youth group meeting—an actual meeting this time, one I couldn't skip without raising suspicion. But Danny and I had planned Thursday at the beach, and I'd told him I'd be there.

I went to the beach.

At youth group later that evening, Sandy pulled me aside during the break.

"Where were you this afternoon?" she asked quietly. "Your mother called my house looking for you. Said she needed you to pick up something from the store on your way home from my place. I covered for you—said you'd just left—but Betty Ann... what's going on?"

My blood ran cold. "My mother called your house?"

"Looking for you. When you were supposed to be there studying." Sandy's worry was etched on her face. "Please tell me you weren't with Danny."

I couldn't answer, which was answer enough.

"Betty Ann." Sandy gripped my arms. "This is serious. Your mother is getting suspicious. What if she'd driven to my house? What if she checks again and I'm not home? You're going to get caught."

"I'll be more careful—"

"You need to stop. This isn't sustainable. You're lying to everyone, sneaking around, taking bigger and bigger risks. For what? A few hours at the beach?"

"For us," I said fiercely. "For Danny and me. For something real."

"But if you get caught—"

"I won't."

"You will." Sandy's voice broke. "Eventually, you will. And when you do, Betty Ann, your father will send you to Georgia. He'll transfer you to a new school. You'll lose everything. Is Danny Cole really worth that?"

The question hung between us. Sandy meant well—she was trying to protect me. But she didn't understand. Couldn't understand.

"Yes," I said quietly. "He's worth it."

Sandy's face showed I'd lost her, at least partially. She didn't believe Danny was worth the risk. Maybe she was right. Maybe I was throwing my life away for summer romance that would fizzle when reality set in.

But walking home that night, I couldn't make myself care about the practical reasons to stop. I'd tasted freedom—the freedom to choose, to want, to risk. Going back to obedient safety felt like suffocation.

In my room, I pulled out my diary. But instead of writing about my day, I sketched Danny's face. Then I crossed it out, afraid someone would find it. I wrote his name in tiny letters in the corner of a page, then scribbled over it until it was illegible.

I felt caught between two worlds: the good daughter my parents wanted and the brave girl Danny saw when he looked at me. I couldn't be both. Not anymore.

Every lie created distance between me and my parents. Every secret meeting was another brick in the wall building between my old life and whatever this new life was becoming.

I'd told Danny I chose him. Now I was living that choice, over and over, with every deception.

But the weight of it was crushing me.

I fell asleep wondering how long I could sustain this. How many more lies before I got caught? How many more risks before my luck ran out?

And what would happen when it inevitably did?
