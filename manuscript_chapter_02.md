# Chapter 2: The Unwanted Assignment

Two days later, I walked to Coral Bay High School on what should have been a perfectly ordinary summer morning.

The building looked strange without students—windows dark, parking lot empty. My saddle shoes scuffed against the hot pavement. I carried my algebra textbook, pages bristling with bookmarks.

Mrs. Henderson had called yesterday, asking if I could meet with her. My heart had leaped with hope. Maybe she'd offer extra tutoring. Maybe she'd found a better way to explain the concepts that kept slipping through my understanding.

The hallway stretched before me, eerily silent. The smell of floor wax and chalk dust hung in the air. I'd always liked school—the structure, the clear expectations, the way hard work translated into good grades. At least, until algebra.

Mrs. Henderson's classroom door stood open. I knocked softly.

"Come in, Betty Ann." Mrs. Henderson looked up from her desk. She was somewhere in her fifties, with graying hair pulled back in a practical bun and shrewd eyes that missed nothing. Students either loved or feared her.

I'd always done my homework.

"Good morning, Mrs. Henderson." I stepped inside, clutching my textbook. "I was hoping we could go over Chapter Seven. The systems of equations are giving me trouble—"

"Sit down, Betty Ann." She gestured to the desk in the front row.

Something in her tone made my stomach clench. I sat.

Mrs. Henderson came around her desk and perched on its edge, regarding me thoughtfully. "How would you describe your understanding of algebra?"

I chose my words carefully. "It's my weakest subject. But I'm working hard to improve. I study every morning, and I think if I can just—"

"You're one of my strongest students," she interrupted. "Despite struggling, you show up, you try, you don't give up."

"Thank you, ma'am." The praise warmed me, but confusion clouded it.

"That's why I've selected you for a special summer project."

My stomach unclenched slightly. Extra credit, maybe.

"This summer, you'll be tutoring Danny Cole in algebra."

The words didn't make sense at first. I heard them individually but they wouldn't connect into meaning.

"I'm sorry?" My voice came out smaller than I intended.

"Danny Cole needs to pass algebra to avoid expulsion. He also needs to pass to maintain eligibility for the Fourth of July hot rod race." Mrs. Henderson's tone was matter-of-fact, as if she hadn't just detonated a bomb in my lap. "You'll tutor him three times per week, starting next Tuesday. The public library will provide a suitable location."

"Mrs. Henderson, I—" My throat felt tight. "There must be some mistake. I barely understand algebra myself. How can I possibly teach someone else?"

"Teaching strengthens understanding." She folded her arms, and I recognized the expression on her face. This wasn't a discussion. This was a done deal. "Explaining concepts to another student will solidify them in your own mind. It's actually an excellent study technique."

"But Danny Cole—" I swallowed hard. "Everyone knows he's... he's..."

"Trouble?" Mrs. Henderson's eyebrows rose. "A troublemaker? A delinquent?"

The words sounded harsh when she said them out loud, but yes. That was exactly what I meant. Danny Cole wore a leather jacket and raced hot rods and came from the run-down marina district. Mothers warned their daughters about boys like Danny Cole. Teachers shook their heads when he slouched past in the hallway. He'd been in the principal's office more times than I'd gotten A's.

"He has a reputation," I said carefully.

"Danny Cole has circumstances." Mrs. Henderson's voice softened slightly. "Which you don't need to know about. What you need to know is that he's not a bad kid, he's struggling, and he needs help. You're going to help him."

"But I'm not qualified—"

"You're more than qualified."

"He won't listen to me—"

"Then you'll find a way to make him listen."

"My parents—" I grasped at this last straw. "My parents won't approve. They won't want me spending time with—"

"This is a mandatory assignment." Mrs. Henderson's tone went firm. "Part of your final grade. I'll be happy to explain that to your parents if necessary. You need honors graduation, don't you? College applications?"

The trap closed around me. She knew exactly which buttons to push.

"I..." My hands twisted the edge of my skirt. "When would this start?"

"Tuesday at two o'clock. The library. I expect you to meet with Danny three times per week for the next six weeks. He'll take his final exam in August. If he passes, you'll both benefit—he'll graduate, and your grade will reflect your excellent work as a tutor."

"And if he doesn't pass?"

Something flickered across Mrs. Henderson's face—worry, maybe, or doubt. "Then he'll be expelled, and he won't be allowed to race in the Fourth of July competition. Which would be a shame, because racing is the only thing that boy has left to care about."

The weight of that settled over me. This wasn't just about algebra. This was about Danny Cole's entire future. No pressure at all.

Mrs. Henderson stood, moving back behind her desk. "I have confidence in you, Betty Ann. More confidence than you seem to have in yourself. Tuesday at two. Don't be late."

I found myself standing, somehow, though I didn't remember deciding to stand. My legs carried me to the door. In the hallway, I stopped and pressed my back against the lockers, breathing hard.

This couldn't be happening.

My perfect, planned summer—studying algebra at my own pace, working at the hardware store, volunteering at church—had just been hijacked. Now I'd be spending hours every week with Danny Cole. Danny Cole, who probably wouldn't even show up. Danny Cole, who would mock me for being a teacher's pet and a goodie-two-shoes. Danny Cole, who my father had specifically warned me to avoid.

I walked home in a daze.

Main Street stretched before me. Normal. Safe. Predictable.

Then I heard it—the roar of an engine, loud and powerful. I turned just as the car came around the corner.

Cherry red. A 1955 Ford, low and sleek. Chrome gleaming. The engine sounded like thunder, like freedom, like everything my father disapproved of.

Behind the wheel sat Danny Cole.

I'd seen him around school, of course. But I'd never really looked at him. Now, frozen on the sidewalk, I couldn't look away.

Dark hair windblown, one arm slung out the window. A white t-shirt, no leather jacket in this heat. He didn't look at me. Didn't glance at the sidewalk or the speed limit signs. The car flew past doing at least fifty in a thirty-five zone, leaving the smell of exhaust and hot rubber.

I stood there watching until the red paint disappeared around the next corner.

That was who I was supposed to tutor? That boy who looked like he'd never followed a rule in his life?

This was impossible.

The rest of the day crawled past. I went through the motions at the hardware store, but my mind stayed stuck on Mrs. Henderson's announcement.

I waited until we'd finished saying grace. Until Mama had served the pork chops and green beans. Until Daddy had taken his first satisfied bite.

"I met with Mrs. Henderson today," I said.

"Oh?" Mama's face brightened. "About your algebra? Did she give you some good study tips?"

"Not exactly." I cut my pork chop into precise squares, not meeting anyone's eyes. "She's assigned me a special project for the summer. I'm going to be tutoring another student."

"How wonderful!" Mama beamed. "That's such an honor, Betty Ann. You must be doing better than you thought."

"Who's the student?" Daddy asked.

I should have lied. Should have made up a name. But I'd never been good at lying.

"Danny Cole."

The temperature in the kitchen dropped ten degrees.

Daddy's fork clattered against his plate. "That Cole boy? The one with the hot rod?"

"Yes, sir."

"Absolutely not."

"Daddy, it's mandatory—"

"I don't care if it's mandatory." His face flushed red. "That boy is trouble, Betty Ann. Everyone knows it. Racing around town like he owns the place, no respect for authority, no respect for the law. He comes from that run-down marina district, probably hasn't had a bath in a week. Works the docks with all those rough men. I won't have my daughter associating with someone like that."

"Walter—" Mama started.

"And it's not just his behavior," Daddy continued, warming to his theme. "It's his attitude. That leather jacket, that smirk, like he's better than everyone when he's barely passing school. Boys like that drag good girls down, Helen. They sweet-talk and charm and the next thing you know, your daughter's reputation is ruined."

"Mrs. Henderson said it's part of my grade," I said quietly. "For honors graduation."

That stopped him. Daddy valued education, valued achievement. He wanted me to graduate with honors, wanted to be able to brag to his friends at Rotary Club about his daughter's success.

His jaw worked. "Where would this tutoring take place?"

"The public library. Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday afternoons."

"During the day?"

"Yes, sir. Two o'clock."

He looked at Mama. She looked worried but said nothing, deferring to him as always.

Finally, Daddy pointed his fork at me. "Public library only. Daytime hours. You tutor him, nothing more. No socializing, no friendly chats, no personal conversations. You teach him algebra and you leave. If I hear you've been seen anywhere else with that boy—the diner, the movies, anywhere—you're done. Understood?"

"Yes, sir."

"And the minute he shows any disrespect, any inappropriate behavior, you tell me immediately."

"Yes, sir."

"I mean it, Betty Ann. Danny Cole is exactly the kind of boy you need to avoid."

I nodded, pushing green beans around my plate. My appetite had vanished.

That night, lying in bed, I stared at my planner. Tuesday: 2:00 PM - Tutor Danny Cole (library). The words looked innocent on paper. Just another appointment. Just another task to check off.

So why did I feel like my whole life was about to change?
