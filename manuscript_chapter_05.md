# Chapter 5: Setting Ground Rules

I arrived at the library Thursday afternoon with a typed list of rules.

I'd spent an hour on Daddy's old typewriter composing it. Retyped it three times to get it perfect.

**TUTORING RULES**
1. Be on time
2. Come prepared with materials
3. No talking back or arguing
4. Focus for the full hour
5. Complete any assigned homework

I'd learned my lesson from Tuesday. Danny wasn't going to take this seriously unless I forced him to. If we were stuck doing this for six weeks, we were doing it properly.

Mrs. Kowalski nodded at me from her desk. I arranged my materials at the same table. Extra pencils, extra paper, a second textbook—just in case.

Two o'clock came and went.

At two ten, the door opened.

Danny Cole walked in—only ten minutes late. An improvement.

Jeans and a white t-shirt today, no leather jacket. He carried a notebook.

He'd brought supplies.

He slid into the chair across from me. Still defensive, but maybe slightly less hostile.

"Hey," he said.

"Hello." I slid the typed rules across the table. "Read these first."

Danny scanned the page. One eyebrow rose.

"You typed rules? For tutoring?"

"If we're going to do this, we need structure."

"Clear control, you mean."

"I mean Tuesday was a disaster. These rules are reasonable. Follow them or don't—but if you don't, I'll tell Mrs. Henderson."

Danny studied the paper, jaw working. Then he set it down and muttered, "Whatever you say, boss."

Not enthusiastic agreement, but he wasn't refusing.

"Good." I opened my algebra textbook. "Let's start. Did you bring materials this time?"

He held up the notebook—spiral-bound, slightly battered. "Yeah."

Small victory.

I took a breath and launched into the lesson. "Today we're reviewing basic linear equations. Last time we didn't get very far, so we'll start from the beginning."

I wrote an example problem on scratch paper, my handwriting neat and clear:

**2x + 3 = 11**

"To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. First, we subtract three from both sides. That gives us 2x = 8. Then we divide both sides by two. So x = 4. Make sense?"

Danny nodded, but I wasn't sure he really understood.

"Your turn." I wrote a similar problem: **3x + 5 = 14**

Danny stared at it. His pencil hovered over the paper. I could see him thinking, could see him trying, but when he finally started writing, the numbers came out wrong.

He scratched out his answer, frustration creasing his forehead. Tried again. Wrong again.

"No, that's not—" I started, my impatience rising. "You're not isolating the variable correctly. You have to subtract five from both sides first, not—"

"I know," he snapped. "I just got confused."

But I could tell he didn't know. Could tell he was guessing, throwing numbers around hoping something would stick. And my sharpness wasn't helping. If anything, I was making it worse, making him defensive, shutting him down.

We were heading straight for another disaster.

I pressed my fingers to my temples, feeling a headache building. How was I supposed to teach someone who didn't understand the most basic concepts? How was I supposed to make this work when every explanation just bounced off him?

My eyes dropped to his notebook, still open on the table.

In the margins, he'd drawn more gears. Detailed mechanical sketches with teeth and rotations marked with careful precision. The drawings were good—really good. Technical and accurate.

An idea flickered.

"Danny." I kept my voice calm. "Your car. The hot rod. What's the gear ratio?"

He looked up, surprised I was asking about cars instead of algebra. "Which gears?"

"I don't know. Any of them."

Confusion crossed his face, but he answered anyway. "My transmission? Third gear is 1.4 to 1. Fourth is direct drive, so 1 to 1."

He said it easily, fluently, like the numbers made perfect sense to him.

My pulse quickened. "Explain what that means. The 1.4 to 1 part."

"It means for every 1.4 rotations of the input shaft, the output shaft rotates once. So if the engine's spinning at 2800 RPM in third gear, the driveshaft's spinning at..." he calculated in his head, "two thousand RPM."

He'd just done fractions and ratios without even thinking about it.

"Danny." I grabbed a fresh piece of paper. "What if I told you that's exactly what you just did? Algebra. You just solved a ratio problem."

"No, I—" He stopped. "That's just gears."

"It's the same thing." I was writing fast now, excited. "Look. If your gear ratio is 1.4 to 1, and your input speed is 2800, we can write that as an equation: 1.4x = 2800, where x is your output speed. To solve for x, divide both sides by 1.4. You get 2000."

His eyes widened slightly.

"You already know how to do this," I said. "You just need to see it in terms that make sense to you."

I rewrote the original equation using car parts: "If your engine RPM divided by your gear ratio equals 2000, and your gear ratio is 1.4, what's your engine RPM?"

Danny stared at the problem. Then he picked up his pencil and wrote:

**1.4 x 2000 = 2800**

"Right!" I couldn't keep the excitement out of my voice. "That's exactly right. You just solved for x."

Something shifted in his expression—surprise, maybe, or the beginning of understanding.

"Try this one." I wrote: "If your fuel mixture is 14.7 parts air to 1 part gasoline, and you're using 2 parts gasoline, how many parts air do you need?"

He solved it in thirty seconds. Correctly.

"Now this." Another problem, this one about speed and distance using his car's top speed.

Right again.

"Displacement calculations." I was making up problems as fast as I could write them, translating every algebra concept into mechanical terms. Engine displacement, fuel consumption rates, gear ratios, speed over distance.

Danny solved them all. Not just correctly—quickly. Confidently. His whole demeanor changed. Instead of that glazed, defeated look, his eyes stayed focused. Alert. He asked clarifying questions: "Is this asking for the ratio or the actual number?" "Do I need to convert units first?"

Real questions. Engaged questions.

We worked through problem after problem. I had to stop and ask him to explain car terminology half the time—what's valve lift? What's compression ratio?—which meant he was teaching me while I taught him. We were actually communicating. Actually working together instead of against each other.

By the time Mrs. Kowalski's clock chimed three, we'd filled four pages with problems. Eight complete equations, all solved correctly.

I sat back, slightly stunned. "You just did more algebra in forty-five minutes than most students do in a week."

Danny looked down at the pages like he couldn't quite believe it either. "The car stuff helps. Makes it... make sense."

"Then we'll keep using it." I was already planning the next session in my head. "I can translate any algebra concept into mechanical terms. If that's how you learn, that's how we'll teach."

He nodded slowly, something like relief crossing his face.

We packed up our materials in silence, but it was different from Tuesday's hostile quiet. This felt less like a standoff and more like a truce.

"You did really well today," I said as I zipped my folder.

Danny looked up, surprise flickering across his features. Like he'd expected criticism or condescension. Like nobody had told him he did well in a long time.

"The car stuff helped," he repeated. "Thanks for... trying that."

It wasn't quite gratitude, but it was close.

"Next session is Saturday. Two o'clock. Same place."

"I'll be here." He hesitated, slinging his notebook under his arm. "And I'll try to be on time."

Not an apology. Not quite a promise. But closer than before.

I watched him walk to the door, his stride less defensive than when he'd arrived. He pushed through the exit, and I caught a glimpse of his red hot rod parked outside before the door swung shut.

For the first time since this nightmare began, I felt something other than dread.

Hope, maybe. Small and tentative, but real.

Maybe this wasn't completely impossible after all. Maybe he could learn—just not the way I'd been taught, not the way textbooks explained it. Maybe I could actually teach him, if I was willing to think differently, to translate instead of just repeat.

I gathered my things and headed for the door.

"Betty Ann," Mrs. Kowalski called from her desk.

I turned. She was looking at me over her reading glasses, and for the first time I could remember, she wasn't frowning.

"That was good work," she said quietly. "Figuring out how he learns. Not many people would have thought of that."

"Thank you, ma'am."

She returned to her book, dismissing me, but I walked out into the afternoon sun feeling lighter than I had in days.

The walk home felt shorter. My mind raced ahead to Saturday's session. Quadratic equations could be acceleration curves. Systems of equations could be two cars traveling different speeds.

I'd need to learn more car terminology. Maybe ask Daddy—he sold auto parts. Or maybe ask Danny. He lit up talking about his car.

By the time I reached home, I'd planned the next three sessions.

Mama was in the kitchen peeling potatoes for dinner. She looked up when I came in.

"How was tutoring?"

"Better," I said, and realized I meant it. "Much better than last time."

"That's wonderful, sweetheart. I knew you could do it. You're such a good teacher."

I wasn't sure about that. But maybe I was learning to be.

In my room, I opened my planner to Saturday and wrote: **Tutor Danny - acceleration problems, velocity graphs.**

Then I opened my algebra textbook, thinking about how to explain concepts in Danny's language.

Gears and engines and speed.

Numbers that meant something real.

Maybe that was the secret to teaching—learning to speak their language.
