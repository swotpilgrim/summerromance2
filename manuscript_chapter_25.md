# Chapter 25: Finding Him

"Danny!" I called out across the parking lot.

He turned at my voice, his expression shifting from melancholy to shock. "Betty Ann? What are you—how did you—"

"I climbed out my window." I walked toward him, my heart pounding so hard I could hear it in my ears. "Again."

"But your father will send you to Georgia—"

"I don't care." I stopped a few feet away from him, suddenly aware that we had an audience. Kids from the dance had followed me outside, drawn by drama more interesting than the sock hop. But I couldn't focus on them. Only on Danny. "I heard you're planning to leave."

His face closed off, defensive. "Who told you?"

"Does it matter? Were you really going to leave without talking to me first?"

"I was trying to do what's best for you." His voice was tight with controlled emotion. "Betty Ann, look at what's happened. You're grounded indefinitely. Your reputation is destroyed. Your father hates me. All because of me."

"All because I chose you!" The words burst out, louder than I intended. More people were gathering now, a crowd forming. Let them watch. Let them all watch. "I chose to go to the race. I chose to defy my father. I chose to climb out my window tonight. Those were my choices, Danny. Not yours. Mine."

"But if I leave, if I'm not here tempting you to break rules—"

"Then you're abandoning me." My voice cracked. "You're doing exactly what you told me love shouldn't be. You're running instead of fighting."

Danny flinched like I'd slapped him. "I'm trying to protect you from more consequences—"

"I don't need protecting!" I moved closer, aware that everyone could hear but past caring. "I need you to trust that I know what I'm choosing. That I'm brave enough to face the consequences. That I'm not some fragile thing that needs to be saved from my own decisions."

"You're seventeen years old—"

"And you're nineteen, barely older, and you're trying to make decisions for both of us!" Frustration and fear and love all tangled together in my chest. "Danny, I've spent my whole life letting other people decide what's best for me. My father deciding my future. My mother deciding my reputation. Teachers deciding my path. And now you want to decide too? To leave 'for my own good' without even asking what I want?"

"I can't watch you suffer because of me," he said, his voice raw. "Every time I see you trapped in your house, cut off from your family, facing consequences—it kills me, Betty Ann. It's killing me."

"Then stay and fight with me!" Tears were streaming down my face now but I didn't care. "Stay and let's face it together. Because you leaving won't undo the consequences—it'll just make them meaningless. It'll mean I sacrificed my parents' trust, my reputation, everything—for nothing."

"That's not fair—"

"None of this is fair!" I was shouting now, past control. "It's not fair that my father judges you without knowing you. It's not fair that loving you costs so much. It's not fair that you think leaving will somehow make it better. But Danny, I'm choosing you anyway. Unfair and all. Consequences and all. I'm choosing you, and I need you to be brave enough to let me."

For a long moment, he just stared at me. Then, in a voice so quiet I barely heard it over the crowd's murmurs: "I love you too much to watch you destroy your future for me."

"Then I love you too much to let you leave without fighting for us." I closed the remaining distance between us and took his face in my hands, not caring who was watching. "I love you, Danny Cole. I love your loyalty to your family. I love your determination to prove everyone wrong. I love how you see me—really see me—as more than just the good daughter. I love you, and I won't let you sacrifice yourself to protect me from my own choices."

His hands came up to cover mine, his eyes bright with unshed tears. "You're sure? Even knowing what it costs?"

"I'm sure. I've never been more sure of anything."

"Betty Ann—" His voice broke. "I don't deserve you."

"Yes, you do. You deserve to be fought for. You deserve someone who sees your worth. You deserve love that doesn't give up when things get hard." I smiled through my tears. "You deserve me, just like I deserve you."

Something in his expression crumbled—all the defenses, all the walls, all the belief that he wasn't good enough. He pulled me into his arms, holding on like I was the only solid thing in a spinning world.

"I'm terrified," he admitted against my hair.

"Good. So am I. We'll be terrified together."

I felt him smile. "You keep saying that."

"Because it's true."

He pulled back just enough to look at me, his hands framing my face. "If I stay—if we do this—I won't let you sacrifice for nothing. I'll finish school properly. I'll prove your father wrong. I'll build something worthy of you."

"You already are worthy of me—"

"Let me earn it anyway." His thumbs brushed away my tears. "Let me show you and your father and this whole damn town that I'm more than my reputation. That choosing me wasn't a mistake."

"It wasn't a mistake." I pressed my forehead to his. "You're the best choice I've ever made."

"Even if your father sends you to Georgia?"

"Even then. We'll figure out the distance. We'll write letters. We'll make it work."

"Even if people talk?"

"Let them talk. I'm done caring about reputation more than I care about being happy."

"Even if it's hard?"

"Especially if it's hard." I pulled back to meet his eyes. "Danny, easy would be giving up. Easy would be letting you leave. Easy would be going back to being the good daughter who never wants anything. But I don't want easy. I want real. I want you."

He was crying now too, we both were, standing in the parking lot surrounded by watching classmates, having the most important conversation of our lives in public.

"Then I'm staying," he said. "I'm staying and we're going to fight for this together. For us."

"Together," I agreed.

Then he kissed me.

Not gentle, not tentative—desperate and claiming and full of every emotion we'd been holding back. I kissed him back with equal intensity, not caring that dozens of people were watching, that this would be all over Coral Bay by morning, that my father would definitely hear about it.

This was my choice. My declaration. My truth spoken publicly and without apology.

When we finally broke apart, both breathless and smiling through tears, I became aware of the crowd. Sandy was crying openly, a huge smile on her face. Rico and Frankie were whooping and clapping. Tommy, Danny's brother, was grinning like he'd won the lottery.

Some faces showed disapproval—the church youth group kids, a few of the more conservative classmates. But more showed support. Respect. Some even admiration for the sheer audacity of what I'd just done.

I'd made my choice publicly. Irrevocably. And I felt nothing but relief.

Danny took my hand and faced the crowd with me. "I'm Danny Cole," he said loudly enough for everyone to hear. "And I love Betty Ann Morrison. Not because she's convenient or easy or expected. Because she's brave and brilliant and sees past reputation to the person underneath. Because she makes me want to be better. Because she's worth every consequence and every fight."

A ripple went through the crowd. This wasn't just teenage drama anymore—this was a declaration that would echo through Coral Bay for years.

"And I'm Betty Ann Morrison," I added, my voice shaking but steady. "And I love Danny Cole. Not despite who he is, but because of who he is. And I don't care what anyone thinks about that. I'm done living for other people's approval."

Sandy started clapping. Slowly, others joined—Tommy, Rico, Frankie, some of our classmates. Not everyone, but enough. Enough to matter.

Danny pulled me close, and I wrapped my arms around him, holding on to the certainty of this choice. Whatever consequences came—and they would come—we'd face them together.

The crowd began dispersing, some heading back to the dance, others to their cars. The show was over. But for Danny and me, something was just beginning.

"Should we go back inside?" Danny asked. "Actually attend the sock hop?"

I thought about dancing with him publicly, making this choice visible to everyone. About not hiding or apologizing.

"Yes," I said. "Let's dance."

We walked back toward the gym hand in hand, past the dispersing crowd, past the whispers and stares. Mrs. Henderson stood in the doorway, and as we passed, she nodded once—approval, or at least acknowledgment.

Inside, "In the Still of the Night" played softly. Danny led me onto the dance floor and pulled me close. We swayed together while the remaining couples danced around us, and for the first time, I felt completely at peace.

I'd made my choice. I'd said it publicly. There was no taking it back.

And I didn't want to.

"I love you," Danny murmured.

"I love you too."

"What happens next?"

"I don't know. But we'll figure it out."

"Together."

"Always together."

We danced until the sock hop ended, until the jukebox fell silent and the chaperones started ushering people out. Then Danny walked me toward home, stopping at the corner two blocks away.

"I should walk the rest alone," I said. "In case my parents are watching."

"Are you sure?"

"I'm sure. But Danny?" I touched his face gently. "Thank you. For staying. For being brave enough to let me choose."

"Thank you for being brave enough to choose." He kissed me one more time, soft and sweet and full of promise. "I'll see you soon. However that happens, I'll see you."

"Soon," I agreed.

I walked the final blocks alone, my heart full despite knowing what awaited. Whatever my father said, whatever consequences came, I'd faced them honestly.

I'd chosen love. I'd chosen bravery. I'd chosen myself.

And that was enough.
