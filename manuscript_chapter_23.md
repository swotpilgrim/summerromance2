# Chapter 23: Escape Plan

I'd never walked two miles in good shoes before. By the time Coral Bay High School came into view, my feet hurt and I was slightly sweaty despite the evening breeze. But I was here. I'd actually done it—climbed out my window, walked across town, and was about to crash the one event my father had explicitly forbidden me to attend.

The parking lot was full of cars. Music and laughter poured from the gymnasium—"Rock Around the Clock" loud enough to hear from the street. Through the lit windows I could see movement, dancers, streamers.

I paused at the edge of the lot, suddenly overwhelmed. Once I walked through those doors, there was no taking it back. Everyone would see me. Everyone would know I'd defied my father's grounding. The gossip that was already bad would become impossible.

But Danny might be inside. And even if he wasn't, even if I'd come here for nothing, at least I'd tried.

I smoothed my dress, checked that my hair was still neat despite the walk, and headed for the gym entrance.

The doors opened to organized chaos. The gymnasium had been transformed—red, white and blue streamers everywhere, balloons clustered in corners, a massive banner reading "Independence Day Sock Hop 1957" stretched across the back wall. The jukebox blasted music while couples danced, some swing dancing energetically, others swaying to slower songs.

The moment I stepped inside, people noticed. Conversations paused mid-sentence. Heads turned. The whispers started immediately.

"That's Betty Ann Morrison—"
"—isn't she grounded?"
"—her father's going to kill her—"
"—what is she thinking?"

I kept my head high and scanned the crowd, searching for one specific face among dozens of familiar ones.

Sarah Jenkins from church stared at me with wide eyes. Tommy Rodriguez from my English class actually smiled and gave me a small nod—like he was impressed. Mrs. Henderson, chaperoning near the punch table, saw me and her expression shifted to something like satisfaction.

But no Danny.

My heart sank. He wasn't here. He'd already decided to leave, or he was avoiding the sock hop, or—

"Betty Ann!" Sandy appeared through the crowd, her face a mixture of shock and concern. "You actually came. You actually climbed out your window and came here."

"I told you I would."

"I know, but I didn't think—" She looked at me with something like awe. "Do you have any idea what you just did? Everyone's staring at you."

"Let them stare." I scanned the crowd again. "Have you seen Danny?"

"I—I don't know. Maybe? I saw some of the racing crowd near the bleachers earlier."

I started moving through the gym, checking every corner. Past the dancers, past the punch table, past clusters of kids who stopped talking as I walked by. Near the bleachers I spotted Rico talking to Frankie.

"Rico!" I called out, not caring about propriety anymore.

He turned, surprised to see me. "Betty Ann? Aren't you supposed to be—"

"Grounded. I know. Have you seen Danny?"

Rico and Frankie exchanged glances. "He was here earlier," Frankie said. "But he left. Said something about getting air."

"Where?"

"Probably out back by the equipment shed. That's where we all hang out when the dance gets too loud."

I was already moving, pushing through the crowd toward the back exit. Sandy called after me but I didn't stop. I burst through the doors into the parking lot area behind the gym.

The music was muffled here, just bass thumping through walls. Cars lined the back lot, some with engines idling, others dark and empty. Scattered groups of kids stood talking and smoking.

And there, leaning against his motorcycle near the equipment shed, was Danny.

He was staring at the gym like he was trying to decide something. His duffel bag was strapped to the bike—packed, ready to leave. He was wearing dark jeans and a white button-down shirt, dressed up for him.

He really was leaving.

My breath caught. Relief at finding him mixed with fury that he'd been about to go without talking to me.

"Danny!" I called out.

He turned at my voice, and his expression went through several emotions in rapid succession: shock, confusion, disbelief, hope.

"Betty Ann?" He pushed off the motorcycle, staring at me like I was a mirage. "What are you doing here? How did you—"

"I climbed out my window." I walked toward him, my shoes clicking on the pavement. "Again."

"But your father—"

"Will definitely send me to Georgia now. I know." I stopped a few feet away, suddenly uncertain how to say everything I needed to say. "I heard you're leaving."

Danny's face closed off slightly. "Who told you?"

"Does it matter? Were you really going to leave without talking to me first?"

He looked away, jaw tightening. "I was trying to do what's best for you."

"By making the decision without me?" Anger made my voice shake. "By deciding what I need instead of asking me what I want?"

"Betty Ann, look at what's happened. You're grounded indefinitely. Your father hates me. Your reputation is destroyed. All because of me."

"All because I chose you!" The words burst out. "I chose to come to the race. I chose to defy my father. I chose to climb out my window tonight. Those were my choices, Danny. Mine. Not yours."

"But if I leave—"

"If you leave, you're abandoning me." My voice cracked. "You're doing exactly what Snake Brennan said good girls do—except you're the one bailing. You're leaving when things get hard instead of staying to fight."

Danny flinched like I'd hit him. "That's not—I'm trying to protect you."

"I don't need protecting! I need you to trust me enough to let me make my own choices, even when those choices are hard." I moved closer. "You told me once that love means fighting, not running away. So why are you running?"

"Because watching you suffer because of me is killing me," he said, his voice raw. "You're trapped in your room. Cut off from your family. Facing consequences that will follow you for years. How can I stay and watch that happen?"

"How can you leave and let it be for nothing?" I countered. "Danny, I've already paid the price. I've already made my choice. Leaving now doesn't undo the consequences—it just makes them meaningless."

He stared at me, conflict clear on his face. "Your father will never accept me."

"Maybe not. But he doesn't have to. I accept you. I choose you. That's what matters."

"Betty Ann—"

"I love you," I interrupted, needing him to hear it clearly. "I love you, Danny Cole. Not despite who you are, but because of who you are. And I'm not going to let you leave without hearing me say that I choose you. Consequences and all. Georgia and all. Whatever comes next, I choose you."

For a long moment, he just looked at me. Really looked at me—standing here in my pink dress with scratched hands from climbing out a window, having walked two miles to crash a dance I was forbidden to attend, defying every rule and expectation to be here.

"You climbed out your window," he said finally, something like wonder in his voice.

"For the second time, yes."

"You walked across town."

"In good shoes, which was a mistake, but yes."

"Knowing your father will send you to Georgia."

"Probably. Most likely definitely." I took the last step between us, close enough to touch. "I'm done playing it safe, Danny. I'm done being the good daughter who never wants anything or chooses anything. You helped me see that I could be brave. Now I need you to be brave too."

"I'm terrified," he admitted.

"Good. So am I. We can be terrified together."

A smile tugged at his mouth—that rare, genuine smile I loved. "You're sure about this? About me?"

"I have never been more sure of anything in my life." I reached up and touched his face gently, tracing the healing split in his lip. "Don't leave. Please. Stay and let's figure this out together."

Danny covered my hand with his, holding it against his cheek. "I love you, Betty Ann Morrison. I love you so much it scares me."

"Then love me enough to stay."

"Okay." The word came out rough but certain. "Okay. I'll stay. We'll figure it out together."

I threw my arms around him, and he pulled me close, holding tight. For a perfect moment, everything else fell away—the consequences waiting, the uncertain future, all of it. Right now, in this moment, we'd chosen each other.

"Betty Ann?" Danny's voice was muffled against my hair. "There are people watching."

I pulled back slightly and looked around. A crowd had gathered—kids from the dance, drawn by the drama. Sandy was there, tears on her face but smiling. Rico and Frankie. Tommy, Danny's brother. Some of my classmates. Even Mrs. Henderson stood in the doorway.

We'd had an audience for our entire conversation.

Which meant by tomorrow morning, everyone in Coral Bay would know exactly what I'd said and done.

I should have cared. The old Betty Ann would have been mortified.

But looking at Danny's face, at the love and relief there, I couldn't make myself regret it.

"Let them watch," I said. "I'm done hiding."

Danny laughed—actually laughed, the sound light and free. Then he kissed my forehead gently. "You're the bravest person I know."

"I learned from you."

"We learned from each other."

We stood there in the parking lot, aware of watching eyes but not caring, just holding each other and knowing we'd survive whatever came next because we'd face it together.

"Should we go inside?" Danny asked eventually. "Actually attend the sock hop we're at?"

I thought about it. About walking back into that gym hand in hand with Danny. About dancing with him publicly while everyone watched. About making this choice visible, permanent, real.

"Yes," I said. "Let's go dance."

We walked back toward the gym doors together, Danny's hand warm in mine. The crowd parted for us. Some faces showed judgment, others approval, most just curiosity.

Sandy fell into step beside me. "You're insane," she whispered. "But I'm so proud of you."

"Thanks for not trying to stop me."

"Would it have worked if I tried?"

"Absolutely not."

She laughed. "That's what I figured."

We entered the gym together—Danny and me and Sandy and the beginning of whatever came next. The jukebox was playing "Earth Angel," sweet and romantic. Couples swayed on the dance floor under streamers and balloons.

Danny turned to face me, opening his arms. "May I have this dance?"

"Always," I said, and stepped into his embrace.

As we swayed to the music, I caught sight of my reflection in the gym windows—flushed cheeks, wild hair, absolutely happy. I barely recognized myself.

But I liked this girl. She was brave. She chose her own path. She fought for what mattered.

Danny made me this girl. Or maybe he just helped me see she'd been here all along.

Either way, I wasn't going back to who I'd been before.

Whatever the consequences, this was who I was choosing to be.
