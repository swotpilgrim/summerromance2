# Chapter 1: The Perfect Summer Plan

The first thing I did on the first morning of summer vacation was check my planner.

I know how that sounds. Sandy Carmichael, my best friend, says I'm the only seventeen-year-old girl in Coral Bay, Florida who owns a planner, let alone actually uses it. But there's something satisfying about seeing the whole summer laid out in neat handwriting. Every day accounted for. Every hour scheduled. No surprises.

I sat up in bed, reached for the planner on my nightstand, and flipped to June. Monday through Friday, 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM: Algebra study session. 10:30 AM to 3:00 PM: Work at Morrison's Hardware. Evenings: Free time (which really meant more studying, but I left that flexible). Saturdays: Church youth group volunteering. Sundays: Church service, family dinner.

Perfect. Controlled. Safe.

My bedroom reflected the same philosophy. The pale yellow curtains matched the pale yellow bedspread, which I'd already smoothed into crisp hospital corners. My books stood arranged by height on the shelf above my desk—tallest on the left, shortest on the right, spines perfectly aligned. My desk itself held exactly three items: the planner, a cup of freshly sharpened pencils, and my algebra textbook, bookmarked at Chapter Seven.

I'd failed exactly one test in my entire academic career. Algebra, last semester. A C-minus that still made my stomach clench when I thought about it. Hence the summer study plan. I would master those equations if it killed me. I would graduate with honors. I would make my parents proud.

"Betty Ann!" My mother's voice floated up the stairs, sweet and patient. "Breakfast!"

I changed out of my nightgown into a simple cotton dress—pale blue with white buttons up to the collar, the kind Mama approved of—and headed downstairs. The smell of eggs and coffee filled our small kitchen. Daddy sat at the head of the table, the Coral Bay Gazette spread before him, reading glasses perched on his nose. He looked up when I entered.

"There's my girl," he said, his voice carrying that tone of approval that never failed to make me sit up straighter. "Right on time, as always."

"Good morning, Daddy." I slid into my usual chair as Mama set a plate in front of me. Scrambled eggs, toast with butter, a small glass of orange juice. The same breakfast we had every morning.

"Your father was just saying how proud we are of you, sweetheart," Mama said, settling into her own seat. She wore a crisp apron over her housedress, her hair already perfectly curled despite the early hour. "So responsible, staying home to study this summer instead of running wild like some of the other girls."

I buttered my toast carefully, keeping my eyes on my plate. "It's important to prepare for the final exam. I need to keep my grades up."

"That's right," Daddy said, folding his newspaper with decisive snaps. "Education is important for a young lady. A woman should know how to keep accounts, help her husband with paperwork when the time comes. Not that she needs to be too ambitious about it." He chuckled, taking a sip of coffee. "Leave the real business to the men, but a sharp mind never hurt anyone."

I nodded, cutting my eggs into neat squares. Daddy owned Morrison's Hardware on Main Street—had for twenty years. A respectable business. A respectable life. He expected me to go to the community college after graduation, maybe study to be a teacher or a nurse. Something suitable. Something that would help me be a good wife and mother eventually.

The eggs tasted like chalk, but I ate them anyway.

After breakfast, I walked the six blocks to Morrison's Hardware. The morning sun already beat down hot enough to make my dress stick to my back. Summer in Florida felt like breathing through a wet towel. Everyone knew everyone in Coral Bay.

The hardware store sat on Main Street between Rosenberg's Pharmacy and the post office. Daddy had painted the storefront forest green last fall, and my name appeared right there on the window in gold letters: "Morrison's Hardware - Walter Morrison, Prop." The little bell above the door chimed when I entered.

The smell hit me immediately—sawdust and paint thinner and metal and something indefinably masculine. I breathed it in, oddly comforted. I knew this place better than anywhere except my own bedroom. I'd been helping here since I was twelve, old enough to work the register and help customers find what they needed.

I tied on my work apron and began my opening routine. Straighten the displays. Restock the nail bins. Dust the shelves. By the time Daddy arrived at 10:00, the store looked perfect.

The morning passed in its usual rhythm. I helped customers find washers, plant food, screws. I rang up purchase after purchase with practiced efficiency. I liked the orderliness of it, the way every item had its place and purpose.

Around noon, Sandy burst through the door like a summer thunderstorm.

"Betty Ann!" She practically bounced across the store, her blonde ponytail swinging. She wore a bright pink sundress that showed her shoulders, the kind of dress my mother would never let me wear. "I've been looking everywhere for you!"

"I'm working, Sandy." But I couldn't help smiling. Sandy had that effect on people.

"I know, I know, but I had to tell you—Ricky Bronson asked me to the movies Friday night! Can you believe it? And Carol said that Jimmy Matthews is going to ask Susan to the Fourth of July sock hop, which means Susan will definitely be going, which means we should definitely go, which means you need to come with me!" She grabbed my hands across the counter, eyes sparkling.

"Sandy, I can't go to the sock hop. I have too much to do this summer."

"You always have too much to do." Sandy's expression turned pleading. "Come on, Betty Ann. It's summer! We're seventeen! Don't you want to have any fun? Meet boys? Fall in love?"

The word "love" hung in the air between us, slightly embarrassing. I felt heat creep up my neck.

"I have to study. And work. And help with the church bake sale. I don't have time for—" I gestured vaguely, "—all that."

"All that?" Sandy threw her hands up dramatically. "You mean life? You mean actually being a teenager instead of a forty-year-old accountant trapped in a seventeen-year-old's body?"

Before I could respond, old Mr. Jacobson shuffled up to the counter with a bag of screws. I rang him up, grateful for the interruption. He smiled at me kindly.

"You're such a sensible young lady, Betty Ann," he said, counting out his change slowly. "Your parents must be very proud. Not like those wild kids racing their hot rods around town, keeping decent people awake all hours."

"Thank you, Mr. Jacobson," I said automatically, handing him his receipt.

After he left, I found Sandy staring at me with an expression somewhere between pity and exasperation.

"Sensible," she repeated. "You're seventeen years old and the best compliment anyone can give you is 'sensible.'" She shook her head. "I love you, Betty Ann, but you're killing me. Promise me you'll at least think about the sock hop?"

"I'll think about it," I lied.

She kissed my cheek and whirled out of the store in a cloud of perfume and optimism, leaving me standing in the sawdust-scented silence.

Sensible.

The word echoed in my head for the rest of the day. Why did it feel less like a compliment and more like a cage?

By the time I got home that evening, I was exhausted. Mama had dinner ready—meatloaf and mashed potatoes. We ate while Daddy talked about the store and Mama talked about the church bake sale and I nodded and felt like I was watching myself from somewhere far away.

After dinner, I retreated to my room and spread my algebra textbook across my desk. Chapter Seven: Systems of Linear Equations. The symbols swam on the page, meaningless hieroglyphics. I'd always been good at English, at history, at anything involving words. But math felt like a foreign language everyone else spoke fluently while I stumbled over the basics.

I worked through the sample problems, checking my answers against the back of the book. Wrong. Wrong. Right—no, wait, I'd copied the number wrong. Still wrong.

Frustration burned in my chest. I pressed my hands against my eyes until I saw stars.

When I lowered my hands, I found myself staring at my pencil. Without thinking, I flipped to a blank page and began to sketch. My hand moved in smooth, confident strokes—so different from the hesitant way I worked through equations. A girl's face emerged. Then the curve of a beach. Waves. Seagrass.

I drew for maybe five minutes before I realized what I was doing.

Guilt crashed over me. This was wasting time. This was frivolous. This was everything my parents had gently discouraged since I was small. "Drawing is a lovely hobby, but it's not practical." "You can't make a living as an artist, Betty Ann."

I grabbed my eraser and scrubbed at the page until the drawings disappeared, leaving only gray smudges and torn paper.

Then I returned to the algebra.

x + y = 7. 2x - y = 5.

The numbers blurred. My eyes burned. But I kept going until 10:00 PM.

I changed into my nightgown and climbed into bed. My planner sat on the nightstand, tomorrow's schedule already written in neat print. Tuesday: Algebra study. Hardware store. Youth group meeting.

Safe. Controlled. Perfect.

I should have felt content. This was exactly what I wanted—a structured, productive summer. No surprises. No complications. Just steady progress toward graduation with honors and making my parents proud.

So why did I feel so restless?

I stared at the ceiling, watching shadows from the streetlight shift across the plaster. Somewhere in the distance, I heard the rumble of a car engine—probably one of those boys in their hot rods Mr. Jacobson had complained about. The ones I was supposed to avoid.

The engine sound faded.

I closed my eyes and told myself tomorrow would be better. The algebra would make sense. The restless feeling would fade. Everything would fall into place.

I fell asleep still believing that, unaware my perfectly planned summer was about to derail completely.
