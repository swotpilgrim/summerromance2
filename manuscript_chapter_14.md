# Chapter 14: Father Finds Out

Wednesday morning at Morrison's Hardware started like any other—the familiar smell of sawdust and machine oil, the weight of my father's ring of keys in my hand as I unlocked the front door, sunlight streaming through the display windows to illuminate rows of paint cans and garden tools.

I was in a good mood despite only five hours of sleep. I'd stayed up late replaying yesterday's conversation with Danny, the way he'd kissed my knuckles, the certainty in his voice when he'd said "always together." The memory made me smile as I flipped the CLOSED sign to OPEN and started my morning routine.

My father arrived at eight, as he always did, carrying his thermos of coffee and the morning paper. He grunted a greeting—his version of "good morning"—and headed to his office in the back.

By nine o'clock, I'd helped three customers: Mr. Jenkins needed wood screws, Mrs. Carlson wanted advice on paint colors for her kitchen, and Bobby Reynolds was building a treehouse and required supervision on proper nail selection. I was restocking the display of gardening gloves when the bell over the door chimed.

Mrs. Patterson swept in like a galleon under full sail, her floral dress billowing, her helmet of gray hair sprayed into submission. She was Coral Bay's most reliable source of gossip, delivered with a smile and a tone of concerned helpfulness that fooled exactly no one.

"Good morning, Mrs. Patterson," I said, summoning my customer service smile. "What can I help you find today?"

"Oh, just some light bulbs for the lamps in the sitting room. Sixty-watt, if you have them." She paused at the counter, setting down her purse. "How's your summer going, dear? Keeping busy?"

"Very busy," I said, walking her to the electrical aisle. "Working here most mornings, and the tutoring takes up quite a bit of time."

"Ah yes, the tutoring." Mrs. Patterson's voice took on that particular quality—sweet as honey with poison underneath. "How is that going? You're helping that Cole boy, aren't you?"

My shoulders tensed. "Danny's making excellent progress."

"I'm sure he is." She examined light bulb packages with exaggerated interest. "I saw you two yesterday, actually. At the beach. Palmetto Beach, wasn't it?"

My stomach dropped. "We meet there for tutoring sessions. It's quieter than the library."

"How lovely." Mrs. Patterson selected a package of bulbs. "Though it did seem quite... casual. Just the two of you on a blanket, very close together. I hope people don't get the wrong idea."

"There's no wrong idea to get," I said, keeping my voice level. "I'm tutoring him in algebra. That's all."

"Of course, dear. I'm sure that's all it is." Her smile was sharp. "Though you know how people talk. A young lady needs to be careful about appearances. Your reputation is such a precious thing."

I rang up her purchase with shaking hands, making change mechanically. Mrs. Patterson took her bag and patted my hand with false sympathy.

"I only mention it because I care, you understand. Your father works so hard to maintain this family's good name. It would be a shame if people started questioning your judgment."

She left in another swirl of floral fabric, and I stood frozen at the counter, my good mood evaporating like morning dew.

She'd seen us. And if Mrs. Patterson had seen us, she'd tell everyone. The church ladies at coffee hour, the garden club at their meetings, anyone who would listen. By Sunday, all of Coral Bay would know Betty Ann Morrison was spending time alone with Danny Cole at the beach.

And Mrs. Patterson's voice had carried. The store wasn't large.

I turned slowly and saw my father standing in the doorway of his office. His face was stone.

"Betty Ann," he said quietly. "A word. Now."

My legs felt like water as I followed him into his office. He closed the door—never a good sign—and stood with his arms crossed, looking at me with an expression I couldn't read.

"Mrs. Patterson saw you at the beach with that boy."

"I was tutoring him—"

"At the beach," my father interrupted. "Alone. On a blanket. 'Very close together,' she said."

"We were working through algebra problems! The beach is quieter than the library, and Danny focuses better outdoors—"

"You will not interrupt me." His voice was still quiet, which somehow made it worse. "How many times have you met this boy at the beach?"

I could lie. Should lie. But the truth would come out anyway, and lying would only make it worse.

"We've been meeting there for the past four weeks. Tuesdays and Thursdays."

His jaw clenched. "Eight times. You've met him alone eight times and never thought to mention this to your mother or me?"

"I didn't think it mattered! I'm tutoring him. That's my assignment from Mrs. Henderson—"

"Mrs. Henderson assigned you to tutor him at the library," my father cut in. "Under supervision. Not to meet him privately at the beach where anyone could see and make assumptions about what you're really doing."

"We're not doing anything wrong!"

"It doesn't matter if you're doing anything wrong!" His voice rose for the first time. "It matters what people think you're doing! Mrs. Patterson will tell everyone. By tomorrow, the whole town will be talking about how Walter Morrison's daughter is sneaking around with the Cole boy. Do you understand what that does to our reputation? To this family's standing in the community?"

"I wasn't sneaking—"

"You deliberately withheld information you knew we wouldn't approve of. That's sneaking, Betty Ann." He paced behind his desk, and I could see him working to control his temper. "This ends now. No more beach meetings. If Mrs. Henderson insists you continue tutoring this boy, you'll do it at the library where it's proper and supervised. That's final."

"That's not fair—"

"Fair?" He wheeled on me. "You want to talk about fair? Let me tell you about Danny Cole. He's been held back twice. He's been in more fights than I can count. He runs with a crowd of hoodlums who race illegally and God knows what else. He comes from nothing, has no prospects, and will drag down anyone foolish enough to associate with him. That's the boy you've been meeting alone at the beach."

"You don't know anything about him!" The words burst out before I could stop them. "Danny works two jobs to support his family. He's smart when someone actually takes the time to teach him properly. He's kind and responsible and nothing like what you think—"

"And how would you know?" My father's voice went dangerous. "How well do you know this boy, Betty Ann? Well enough to defend him with that kind of passion? Well enough to risk your reputation for him?"

I couldn't answer without confirming exactly what he suspected.

"That's what I thought." His expression showed disappointment and anger in equal measure. "You're seventeen years old. You don't know what you think you know about boys like Danny Cole."

"I know he's a good person who deserves a chance—"

"He's had plenty of chances! And he's wasted every one of them failing classes and getting into trouble." My father planted his hands on his desk. "I will not allow my daughter to throw away her future for some misguided crush on a boy who's going nowhere."

"It's not misguided!" I was shouting now, propriety abandoned. "And he's not going nowhere! He's trying, he's working hard, he just needs someone to believe in him!"

"Well it won't be you." My father's voice was final. "Effective immediately, you are forbidden from seeing Danny Cole outside of supervised library sessions. No beach. No private meetings of any kind. Is that understood?"

"No! That's not—you can't—"

"I'm your father. I can and I am." He moved toward the door. "We'll discuss this further at home with your mother. Right now, you need to finish your shift. And Betty Ann? If I hear about any more beach meetings or anywhere else you shouldn't be with that boy, there will be serious consequences."

He left the office, leaving me standing there with tears streaming down my face and rage burning in my chest.

The rest of the morning shift passed in a blur. Customers came and went. I helped them mechanically, hearing my voice explain product features and make change without really being present. My mind spun with fury and fear and desperate planning.

My father couldn't forbid me from seeing Danny. He couldn't. We'd just found each other, just admitted what we felt, just committed to figuring this out together. I wouldn't let Mrs. Patterson's gossip and my father's prejudice end something real before it even had a chance to begin.

But as I watched my father behind the counter, his disappointment clear in every line of his body, I felt the weight of his authority pressing down. While I lived under his roof, I followed his rules. That's how our family worked.

Unless I didn't.

The thought was so foreign, so revolutionary, it took my breath away. Unless I didn't follow his rules. Unless I chose my own path despite his disapproval.

The good daughter would obey. Would accept the library sessions under supervision and let the relationship with Danny fade into propriety.

But I wasn't just the good daughter anymore. Danny had helped me see that. I was Betty Ann who wanted things, who chose things, who was brave enough to fight for what mattered.

The question was: was I brave enough to defy my father?

That evening, dinner was a tense affair. My mother had clearly been filled in—her eyes were red from crying, and she kept dabbing at them with her handkerchief between bites of pot roast that none of us tasted.

My father waited until we'd all finished eating before he spoke. "Betty Ann has been meeting the Cole boy privately at the beach. I've forbidden any further contact outside of supervised tutoring at the library."

My mother gasped as if this was news, though she clearly already knew. "Betty Ann, how could you?"

"I was tutoring him, like Mrs. Henderson assigned—"

"Don't give me that," my father interrupted. "You knew it was inappropriate or you would have told us about the beach sessions. You deliberately hid it because you knew we wouldn't approve."

He was right, and we all knew it.

"The question now," my father continued, "is whether you can be trusted to follow this rule, or whether more drastic measures are needed."

"What kind of measures?" I asked, though I dreaded the answer.

"Your Aunt Martha in Georgia has offered several times to have you visit for an extended stay. If you can't be trusted here, perhaps a summer in Valdosta would help you remember your priorities."

Georgia. Away from Coral Bay, away from Danny, away from everything. The threat was clear.

"That's extreme," I protested.

"Extreme is choosing a boy with no future over your family's good name," my father countered. "Extreme is risking everything your mother and I have worked to build—our reputation, our standing in this community—for a summer infatuation with someone completely inappropriate."

"It's not an infatuation!" The words escaped before I could stop them.

My father's eyes narrowed. "Then what is it?"

I couldn't answer. Not without making everything worse. Not without admitting that I cared about Danny, really cared, in a way that would only confirm my father's worst fears.

"That's what I thought." He stood, signaling the conversation was over. "You're grounded for two weeks. Work and home only. No phone privileges. And if I hear about you disobeying, Georgia isn't a threat—it's a promise."

I retreated to my room, threw myself on my bed, and cried harder than I had since childhood. The injustice of it burned in my chest. My father had decided who Danny was without ever meeting him, without giving him a chance, based entirely on reputation and prejudice.

And he'd decided I was too young, too naive to know my own heart.

The rage beneath the tears was new. I'd never questioned my father's authority before, never imagined defying him. But lying there on my bed, feeling trapped and helpless and furious, something crystallized inside me.

I'd told Danny I was choosing him. I'd said I wouldn't let my comfortable life be more important than us.

Now I'd have to prove it.
