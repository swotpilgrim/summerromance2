# Chapter 3: Danny's Ultimatum

Danny Cole dragged himself into Principal Morrison's office running on three hours of sleep and spite.

His eyes felt like someone had poured sand in them. His clothes—yesterday's jeans and a t-shirt that had seen better days—reeked of fish guts and motor oil from the night shift at the marina docks. He'd clocked out at six in the morning, gone home to shower and change, discovered he had no clean clothes left, and wore the same outfit anyway because laundry cost quarters they didn't have.

Now it was two in the afternoon and he was about to get expelled.

He knew the routine. Slouch into the chair across from the principal's desk. Don't make eye contact. Keep his face blank. Whatever they thought he'd done, they were probably right. Or if they were wrong, they wouldn't believe him anyway, so what was the point?

Principal Morrison sat behind his desk looking grim. Mrs. Henderson, his algebra teacher, stood by the window. The two of them together meant this was serious.

"Mr. Cole." Principal Morrison folded his hands on the desk. "Thank you for coming."

Like Danny had a choice.

"We need to discuss your academic progress," the principal continued. "Or rather, your lack of progress."

Danny stared at a spot on the wall behind the principal's head. A water stain shaped like Texas. He'd noticed it during his last three visits to this office.

"You're failing algebra," Mrs. Henderson said. Her voice was matter-of-fact, not unkind. "Again."

"Yes, ma'am." No point denying it.

"This is your second senior year, Mr. Cole. You failed junior year after your father passed away, which we understood. You were dealing with grief and new responsibilities. We gave you grace." Principal Morrison leaned forward. "But you're failing again. That grace has run out."

Danny's jaw tightened. Grace. Like they'd done him some massive favor by letting him stay in school while his whole world collapsed.

"Here's the situation," Principal Morrison said. "If you don't pass your algebra final exam in August, you will be expelled. Permanently. You will not graduate. You will not be eligible for any school activities."

Danny's stomach dropped. "Activities?"

"Including," the principal said slowly, "the Fourth of July hot rod race."

No.

The word screamed through Danny's head but he didn't let it reach his face. He couldn't let them see. The race was everything—the only thing in his miserable existence that was his. His car, his skill, his one chance to prove he was worth something. The prize money was five hundred dollars. Five hundred dollars that could pay three months' rent, or fix the roof that leaked into Sarah's bedroom, or buy Tommy new shoes that didn't have holes.

"However," Mrs. Henderson stepped forward, "we're offering you a solution."

Danny's eyes snapped to her. A solution that involved him sitting in this office couldn't be good.

"Betty Ann Morrison has agreed to tutor you in algebra. Three sessions per week, starting next Tuesday. If you attend every session, complete the work, and pass your final exam, you'll graduate on time and maintain eligibility for the race."

Betty Ann Morrison.

Perfect Betty Ann with her perfect grades and perfect dresses buttoned up to her perfect chin. The girl who'd probably never broken a rule in her life, never disappointed anyone, never had to choose between eating and keeping the electricity on.

The girl who definitely thought he was trash.

"What if I say no?" The words came out before he could stop them.

Principal Morrison's expression hardened. "Then you're expelled effective immediately."

Of course.

Danny's mind raced, calculating impossibilities. He worked six nights a week at the marina—ten PM to six AM, loading fishing boats and hauling nets and doing whatever backbreaking labor needed doing for nine dollars a night. Fifty-four dollars a week that kept his mother, his three siblings, and himself fed. His mom worked the breakfast and lunch shift at Rosie's Diner, but her wages barely covered rent on their run-down house in the marina district.

The diner had cut her hours last month.

They were already choosing between electricity and groceries.

Now he was supposed to add tutoring to a schedule that didn't have room for sleep?

But without the race, without that prize money, they'd be evicted by September. And without graduation, he'd never get any job better than dock work. He'd be stuck forever in the same cycle that killed his father—brutal work, no future, drowning slowly.

"I'll do it," he heard himself say.

Mrs. Henderson nodded like she'd known he would. "Tuesday at two o'clock. The public library. Don't be late."

"Yes, ma'am."

"And Danny?" She caught his eye. "Actually try. Betty Ann is giving up her summer to help you. The least you can do is show up and work."

He nodded curtly, already standing. If he stayed in this office one more minute, he might say something that would get him expelled anyway.

Outside, the afternoon sun hit him like a fist. He squinted, fumbled for his sunglasses—scratched, one arm held on with electrical tape—and headed for his car.

His beautiful, perfect car.

The only thing in his life that made sense.

The cherry red '55 Ford sat in the student parking lot, chrome gleaming, engine purring. He'd built this car with his own hands, scrounging parts from junkyards, working weekends at Sal's garage in exchange for tools and knowledge. Every bolt, every wire, every inch of metalwork—his.

Nobody could take this away from him.

He slid behind the wheel, fired up the engine, and felt the familiar rumble calm something jagged in his chest. This was real. This was his.

He drove home—if you could call it home. The marina district sat on the wrong side of Coral Bay, where the houses leaned and the paint peeled and the smell of fish and salt water never quite went away. His house was worse than most—a shotgun shack his father had rented for forty dollars a month, now fifty because the landlord knew they had nowhere else to go.

Danny pulled around back to the lean-to shed that served as his garage. The shed wasn't much—just a roof and three walls—but it kept the rain off his car. Mostly.

Tommy was already there, bent over the open hood, adjusting the carburetor.

"Hey." Tommy looked up, wiping his hands on a rag. At thirteen, he was already taller than their mom, all elbows and knees and dark hair that stuck up no matter how much he combed it. He had Dad's eyes. They all did.

"Hey, squirt." Danny grabbed a wrench from his toolbox and joined him. "What're you doing to my engine?"

"Adjusting the idle. It's running rough." Tommy stepped back to give Danny access. "What'd the principal want?"

Danny focused on the carburetor, not his brother's face. "I'm failing algebra again."

"Again?"

"Yeah."

"What'd they say?"

"They're making me do tutoring. Three times a week." Danny tightened a screw, testing the adjustment. "If I don't pass, I'm expelled."

"And the race?"

"Banned."

Tommy was quiet for a moment. "Who's tutoring you?"

"Betty Ann Morrison."

"Morrison?" Tommy's voice shot up. "Like, perfect-grades, hardware-store Morrison? That Morrison?"

"Yeah." Danny straightened, wiping his hands. "That one."

"Wow." Tommy looked impressed. "She's pretty."

"She's stuck-up."

"You ever actually talked to her?"

"Don't need to. I know the type." Danny reached for the oil pan, needing something to do with his hands. "Rich girl playing charity case. Probably thinks she's doing me some big favor, lifting up the poor dumb kid from the marina."

"We're not rich," Tommy pointed out. "But we're not dumb either."

Danny grunted. Tommy was right—they weren't dumb. Tommy was pulling straight A's despite wearing shoes two sizes too small. Ten-year-old Sarah read at an eighth-grade level. Eight-year-old Marco could calculate baseball statistics in his head faster than Danny could write them down.

And Danny had been on the honor roll before Dad died.

Before the night shifts started.

Before sleep became a luxury he couldn't afford.

"Maybe she can actually help," Tommy said quietly. "Maybe you just need someone to explain it different."

"Maybe." Danny didn't believe it, but he couldn't crush the hope in his little brother's voice. Tommy still thought the world was fair, that hard work mattered, that people got what they deserved.

Danny knew better.

But he also knew he didn't have a choice.

"I gotta make this work, Tommy." He closed the hood, running his hand over the smooth red paint. "Six weeks till the race. If I can pass that exam, win that race, we'll have breathing room. Real breathing room."

"You'll win." Tommy said it like fact, not hope. "Nobody beats you."

Danny wished he had half his brother's confidence.

That night, after his shift at the docks, after checking on Sarah and Marco sleeping in the room they shared, after making sure his mom had taken her blood pressure medication, Danny lay in his narrow bed and stared at the ceiling.

Tuesday. Two o'clock. Library.

Betty Ann Morrison with her pristine dresses and judgmental eyes.

Three hours a week pretending he wasn't exactly what she thought he was—the troublemaker, the delinquent, the lost cause from the wrong side of town.

He'd suffered through worse.

And if tutoring was the price for racing, for that five hundred dollars, for proving everyone wrong about Danny Cole, he'd pay it.

Even if it killed him.
