# Chapter 27: Public Commitment

The walk home felt both too long and too short. I wanted time to prepare for what awaited, but I also wanted to face it and get it over with. Two blocks. Three. My house came into view, porch light glowing, my father's truck in the driveway.

They were home. Of course they were home.

I'd expected them to still be at the church meeting. But looking at the clock on the town square as I passed—10:23 PM—I realized the meeting had ended over an hour ago. They'd returned home to find me gone, my bedroom door still locked from the outside but me nowhere to be found.

They knew I'd escaped again. They'd probably been waiting for me to come home.

Sure enough, as I approached the front walk, the door opened. My father stood silhouetted in the doorway, his expression unreadable in the shadows.

"Inside," he said. Just that one word.

I walked past him into the living room. My mother sat on the sofa, handkerchief clutched in her hands, eyes red from crying. My father closed the door with deliberate care and turned to face me.

"How?" he asked. "Your door was locked."

"I climbed out the window." No point lying now. "The rose trellis. Same way as last time."

A muscle twitched in his jaw. "To go where?"

"The sock hop. I needed to see Danny."

"Needed." He said it like the word was distasteful. "You needed to defy direct orders, climb out of a locked room, and attend an event you were explicitly forbidden from attending."

"Yes."

"Why?" The question came out raw. "Why can't you just obey? Just trust that we know what's best for you?"

"Because you don't," I said quietly. "You don't know what's best for me, Dad. You know what's safe. What's comfortable. What fits your vision of who I should be. But you don't know what makes me happy."

"And Danny Cole makes you happy?" The disbelief was clear.

"Yes. He does. He makes me feel seen and valued and brave enough to want things for myself instead of just accepting what everyone else wants for me."

My father turned away, running a hand over his face. "You're seventeen years old. You don't know what you want—"

"I'm seventeen years old and I'm telling you what I want!" My voice rose despite my intention to stay calm. "I want to be allowed to make my own choices. I want to pursue art instead of teaching. I want to date Danny despite his reputation. I want to live my own life instead of performing the life you've imagined for me!"

"And what kind of life do you think you'll have with Danny Cole?" My father wheeled on me. "Working minimum wage jobs? Struggling to make rent? Raising kids you can't afford while he works nights at the marina? That's the future you're choosing!"

"That's your assumption about the future. Not reality."

"It's based on facts! The boy has no prospects—"

"The boy has dreams and determination and has already proven he can accomplish things when someone believes in him!" I was shouting now, past control. "He passed algebra with a B-minus. He won the racing championship. He supports three younger siblings at nineteen years old. He's not the failure you think he is!"

"Even if he succeeds, even if he beats the odds—you'll have sacrificed your opportunities for his struggles. You'll wake up at thirty and resent him for what you gave up."

"Or I'll wake up at thirty and be grateful I was brave enough to choose love over convenience!" I blinked back tears. "Dad, you're so worried about me regretting choosing Danny. What about regretting not choosing him? What about waking up at thirty in a safe, respectable life wondering what if? What if I'd been brave enough to try? What if I'd fought for what I actually wanted instead of accepting what was expected?"

My father stared at me like I was a stranger. Maybe to him, I was. The obedient daughter who never questioned had transformed into someone who defied and demanded and chose her own path.

"I don't know you anymore," he said finally, and the hurt in his voice cut deeper than anger would have.

"Then get to know me. The real me. Not the version you want me to be."

"The real you climbs out windows and lies to her parents?"

"The real me is brave enough to fight for what matters. Even when it's hard. Even when people I love don't approve." I wiped tears from my face. "You taught me that, actually. You and Mom both. You taught me to stand up for what's right, to fight for what I believe in, to not back down from challenges. I'm just applying those lessons to my own life instead of the life you've chosen for me."

My mother made a small sound. My father just shook his head.

The phone rang, cutting through the tension. My father answered it, his voice clipped. "Hello?"

His expression shifted as he listened. "Yes, Mrs. Henderson. ...Yes, we're aware she attended the sock hop. ...I see. ...Is that so?" A long pause. "I appreciate you calling."

He hung up and turned back to me, his expression unreadable. "That was Mrs. Henderson. She wanted to inform us about tonight's events before we heard through gossip."

"What did she say?"

"That she witnessed your public declaration of love for Danny Cole. That the entire school will be talking about it by tomorrow." He paused. "She also said that in thirty years of teaching, she's rarely seen a student as dedicated as Danny Cole was during the tutoring. That he demonstrated genuine intelligence and work ethic when given proper instruction. That he was completely respectful toward you throughout the process."

Hope flickered in my chest. "She called to tell you that?"

"She called," my father said slowly, "to provide context before I reacted too harshly." He sat heavily in his armchair. "Betty Ann, what you did tonight—defying us, climbing out windows, making public declarations—was wrong. The disobedience, the sneaking, the lies. All wrong."

"I know—"

"But." He held up a hand. "I'm also starting to see that forbidding you has accomplished nothing except making you rebellious and secretive. That perhaps..." He paused, clearly struggling with the admission. "Perhaps I don't know Danny Cole as well as I think I do."

I hardly dared breathe. "What are you saying?"

"I'm saying you're still grounded for two weeks for climbing out that window. No negotiation on that." His voice was firm. "But after that... if Danny Cole wants to see you properly, he can. With our knowledge. Following our rules."

"Really?" I couldn't process what I was hearing.

"He'll come to Sunday dinner. Meet us formally. Court you properly—with supervision, curfews, check-ins." My father's expression was stern. "And if he breaks any rule, if he disappoints you or disrespects our family, he's done. No second chances. Understood?"

"Yes. Yes, understood." Tears were streaming down my face now—relief and gratitude and disbelief all mixed together. "Thank you, Dad."

"Don't thank me. I still think you're making a mistake. But I also see that trying to control you is only making things worse." He sighed, looking suddenly older. "So I'm giving you rope, Betty Ann. Hopefully enough to find your way, not enough to hang yourself with."

My mother stood and came to hug me, crying. "We love you. Even when we don't understand your choices, we love you."

"I love you too," I whispered. "And I'm sorry for the lying. For the sneaking. I won't do that anymore."

"You better not," my father said. "Because if you do, Georgia isn't a threat anymore. It's a promise."

"I understand."

He stood. "Now go to bed. We'll discuss the details of the grounding in the morning. And Betty Ann?" He paused at the doorway. "Danny Cole better be worth all this trouble."

"He is, Dad. He really is."

After my parents went upstairs, I sat in the living room processing what had just happened. My father—stern, unbending Walter Morrison—had given permission for Danny to court me. With conditions and supervision and threats if anything went wrong, but still. Permission.

Mrs. Henderson's call had made the difference. Her endorsement of Danny's character, her witnessing of our connection, her professional opinion carrying weight my emotional pleas couldn't.

I climbed the stairs to my room—door unlocked now, apparently trust slightly restored—and immediately went to my desk. I pulled out paper and started writing.

*Dear Danny,*

*Miracle of miracles—my father said yes. You can court me officially, with their knowledge. But there are conditions...*

I listed everything: the two-week grounding, the requirement for Sunday dinner, the curfews and supervision and rules. The threat hanging over everything if he made one mistake.

*I know it's a lot. I know it's not ideal. But it's a chance. A real chance for us.*

*I love you. And I'll see you in two weeks, if not before.*

*Always,*
*Betty Ann*

Tomorrow I'd find a way to get the letter to him through Tommy and Rico's network. For tonight, I folded it carefully and tucked it in my desk drawer.

Then I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, hardly able to believe it. We'd done it. Against all odds, through defiance and declarations and Mrs. Henderson's intervention, we'd won our chance.

Now we just had to prove we could make it work.
