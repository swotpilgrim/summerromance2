# Chapter 29: Romantic Dance Together

The summer passed in careful, supervised stages. Danny came for Sunday dinner every week without fail, answering my father's questions with patience and honesty. We attended church events together, always chaperoned. We sat on the porch swing under my father's watchful eye, talking for hours about everything and nothing.

It was slow. Frustrating at times. But it was ours.

Danny worked his shifts at the marina, saved his money religiously. On his nineteenth birthday in mid-July, he opened a savings account specifically for his future garage. The first deposit was the race prize money: five hundred dollars.

I applied to three art schools—Atlanta, Savannah, and one in Charleston. My father didn't forbid it, though his disapproval was clear. My mother quietly encouraged me to follow my dreams.

Senior year started in September. Danny attended every class, turned in every assignment. Mrs. Henderson reported that he was passing with solid B's. My father nodded acknowledgment but didn't praise.

By October, something had shifted. My father still didn't approve of Danny—probably never fully would. But he respected Danny's consistency. The way he showed up every Sunday at five o'clock sharp. The way he had me home by curfew without exception. The way he called my father "sir" and my mother "ma'am" and never pushed the boundaries.

"He's stubborn," my father admitted one evening after Danny had left. "I'll give him that."

Coming from Walter Morrison, it was almost a compliment.

In November, Danny and I were finally allowed unsupervised dates—still with curfews, still with check-ins, but alone. Our first real date was the Thanksgiving church social, dancing to big band music while the whole community watched.

December brought my art school acceptance letters. Atlanta wanted me. So did Savannah. Charleston offered a partial scholarship.

"What are you going to do?" Danny asked, sitting on my porch swing on a cold December afternoon.

"I think... Atlanta. It's closest to Coral Bay. Three hours. You could visit on weekends, eventually."

"I will visit on weekends. As many as I can afford gas for."

I leaned into his shoulder, his arm coming around me. Six months of supervised courtship meant we knew each other better than many couples who'd dated twice as long. We'd talked through everything—fears, dreams, plans, doubts. We'd built something real on a foundation of honesty.

"Next semester will be hard," I said. "Long distance."

"We'll write letters. Call when we can." Danny pressed a kiss to my temple. "We've faced harder things."

"True."

Christmas Eve found our families sharing dinner for the first time—my parents, Danny's mother and siblings, all crammed around our dining room table. It was loud and chaotic and wonderful. Sarah, Danny's sister, brought her horse drawings to show my mother. Marco challenged me to arm wrestling. Tommy talked cars with my father.

"This is good," Danny whispered to me while clearing dishes. "Our families together."

"It's really good."

My father gave Danny a gift that night—a toolbox, practical and expensive. "For when you open that garage," he said gruffly.

Danny's eyes went bright. "Thank you, sir. This... thank you."

It wasn't full acceptance. But it was acknowledgment that my father saw Danny's dreams as legitimate.

Spring arrived with college acceptance confirmations and senior year winding down. Danny would graduate—for real this time. I would head to Atlanta in August.

On a warm May evening, Danny took me to Palmetto Beach—our spot where everything had started. We spread the same faded blanket, watched the same waves, existed in the same space where I'd first taught him algebra.

"Remember when you made those car-based math problems?" Danny asked, lying back on the blanket.

"You mean the only way I could get you to understand ratios?" I teased.

"I understood just fine. I just liked watching you explain things." He pulled me down beside him. "You get this little crease right here when you're concentrating." He touched between my eyebrows gently.

"I do not."

"You absolutely do. It's adorable."

We lay on the blanket watching the sun set, painting the sky in oranges and pinks. A year ago, we'd been sneaking around, lying to my parents, terrified of consequences. Now we were here openly, honestly, building something that would last.

"I'm scared," I admitted. "About Atlanta. About the distance."

"Me too." Danny laced his fingers through mine. "But we'll figure it out. Letters, phone calls, weekend visits. And Betty Ann? I'm saving money. Working extra shifts. In a year, maybe two, I'll have enough to move to Atlanta. Open that garage I've been planning."

"You'd move to Atlanta? For me?"

"I'd move anywhere for you. But Atlanta makes sense—big city, lots of car enthusiasts, good business potential." He turned to face me. "We can build a future there. Together."

"Together," I agreed.

He kissed me then—soft and sweet and full of promise. A year of supervised courtship meant we'd earned these moments. My father trusted us. We'd proven ourselves.

The future stretched before us—uncertain but possible. I'd go to art school. Danny would finish at the marina, save his money. We'd write letters and make phone calls and visit when we could.

And eventually, we'd build something permanent.

"I love you," Danny said.

"I love you too."

We watched the sun disappear below the horizon, the sky fading from orange to purple to deep blue. Stars began appearing, one by one, bright against the darkness.

This beach, this blanket, this boy—they'd changed everything. A year ago I'd been the perfect daughter terrified of disappointing anyone. Now I was the girl brave enough to choose my own path.

Danny had shown me that girl. Or maybe he'd just helped me see she'd been there all along.

Either way, I wasn't going back.
