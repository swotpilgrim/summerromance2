# Chapter 24: The Sock Hop

The gymnasium felt different now that I'd made my choice public. Walking in with Danny, hand in hand, wasn't sneaking or hiding or pretending. It was declaring exactly who I was choosing and not apologizing for it.

The music wrapped around us—"Earth Angel" transitioning into "Only You" as we reached the dance floor. Danny pulled me close, his hand warm on my back, my fingers laced with his. We swayed together while dozens of eyes watched, and for the first time, I didn't care about the stares.

"You're really here," Danny murmured, like he still couldn't quite believe it.

"I'm really here." I rested my head against his shoulder, breathing in the scent of him—motor oil and soap and something distinctly Danny. "And I'm not going anywhere."

His arms tightened around me. "Even when your father finds out you climbed out your window again?"

"Especially then." I pulled back to meet his eyes. "Danny, I need you to understand something. Whatever happens with my father, whatever consequences I face—I don't regret this. I won't regret it. Choosing you was the first real choice I've made in my life."

"Betty Ann—"

"I mean it. You make me brave. You make me real. And I'd rather face every consequence than lose that."

Something in his expression cracked open, vulnerable and awed. "How did I get this lucky?"

"You took a chance on the honor roll princess who couldn't teach algebra without using car metaphors."

He laughed, and the sound made several nearby dancers glance over with curiosity. Danny Cole laughing—genuinely, openly—was apparently noteworthy.

We danced through two more songs, neither of us wanting to break the moment. Around us, other couples filled the floor. Some were obviously talking about us—I caught whispers and sidelong glances—but others just danced, accepting our presence as part of the evening.

Sandy appeared during a song transition, grabbing my arm. "Betty Ann, I need to tell you something."

"What?"

"People are talking. And I mean really talking. Half the gym saw your conversation with Danny outside. They heard what you said." She glanced around nervously. "By tomorrow morning, your father is going to know you climbed out your window, crashed the sock hop, and told Danny Cole you love him in front of witnesses."

"I know."

Sandy blinked. "You... know?"

"I know. I don't care." I squeezed her hand. "Sandy, for seventeen years I've worried about what people think. What people say. Whether I'm living up to expectations. I'm done with that. Let them talk."

"Your father—"

"Will do what he's going to do regardless." I felt strangely calm about it. "At least this way, I'm being honest. No more sneaking around. No more lies. Just me, making my choice clearly."

Sandy stared at me like I'd transformed into someone she didn't recognize. Maybe I had. "Who are you and what have you done with my best friend?"

"I'm still your best friend. Just... braver now."

She hugged me suddenly, fiercely. "I'm proud of you. Even if you're being completely insane."

When Sandy released me, I found Danny watching with a soft expression. "Your friends are good people."

"Some of them." I glanced around the gym. Not everyone was friendly—I caught disapproving glares from the church youth group corner, heard snippets of harsh whispers. But Rico and Frankie were openly supportive, and Tommy had given me an enthusiastic thumbs-up earlier.

The song changed to something upbeat—"Great Balls of Fire"—and the energy shifted. Couples broke apart to dance more energetically, girls' skirts twirling as they spun. Danny took my hand and tried to teach me a basic swing step, both of us laughing when I stumbled.

"I'm not very good at this," I admitted, out of breath.

"Neither am I. We'll figure it out together."

We danced badly through three fast songs, grinning like idiots the whole time. Other dancers gave us space, some smiling at our enthusiasm, others just shaking their heads.

During a water break at the punch table, I noticed Mrs. Henderson watching from her chaperoning post. She caught my eye and nodded slightly—acknowledgment, maybe even approval. She'd put us together for the tutoring. Maybe she'd hoped for exactly this outcome.

"Miss Morrison." Her voice made me turn. She'd approached while I was distracted. "You're showing considerable courage tonight."

"Or considerable stupidity," I said wryly.

"Sometimes those look very similar." Her expression was unreadable. "Your father will be informed of your presence here."

"I know."

"And you came anyway."

"I came anyway."

Mrs. Henderson studied me for a long moment. Then her stern expression softened into something almost like pride. "Mr. Cole passed his algebra final because you believed he could. You're here tonight despite the consequences because you believe in something more important than rules. That's not stupidity, Miss Morrison. That's integrity."

She walked away before I could respond, leaving me blinking back unexpected tears.

"What did she say?" Danny asked, returning with two cups of punch.

"That I have integrity." I accepted the punch gratefully. "I think that was a compliment."

"Definitely a compliment."

We found a spot on the bleachers and sat watching the dancers. Danny's arm around my shoulders, my head on his shoulder, both of us just existing in the moment. The music played, couples swayed, streamers caught the breeze from open doors.

"What happens after tonight?" Danny asked quietly. "When we leave here and face reality?"

"I don't know," I admitted. "My father will probably follow through on the Georgia threat. You'll stay in Coral Bay to finish senior year. We'll figure out the distance somehow."

"Letters," Danny suggested. "I'll write you every week."

"And phone calls when my aunt allows them."

"And visits when I've saved enough for gas money."

We were planning around obstacles, finding ways to make the impossible work. It wouldn't be easy. Long distance, parental disapproval, uncertain futures. But sitting here with Danny's arm around me, I believed we could do it.

"After graduation," I said slowly, "I want to apply to art school in Atlanta."

"That's three hours from here."

"Close enough to visit on weekends." I looked up at him. "If you wanted to. Once you've graduated and can move more freely."

"If I wanted to?" He sounded incredulous. "Betty Ann, I'll visit every weekend I can afford gas. I'll get a job in Atlanta if that's what it takes. Whatever lets us be together."

The certainty in his voice made my eyes sting. "You mean that."

"I've never meant anything more." He kissed my temple gently. "You fought for me tonight. The least I can do is fight for us."

"Together," I corrected.

"Together," he agreed.

The evening rolled on. We danced more—both fast and slow songs. We talked to other kids, some friendly, others coldly polite. We existed in public as a couple, not hiding or apologizing.

Around nine-thirty, I noticed the crowd starting to thin. Parents arriving for pickup, older kids heading to after-parties. The real world creeping in at the edges of our bubble.

"I should probably get home," I said reluctantly. "Before my parents come looking."

Danny's expression darkened with worry. "Betty Ann, what's going to happen when you get there?"

"My father will be furious. My mother will cry. They'll probably pack me off to Georgia within the week." I tried to sound braver than I felt. "But I'll survive it. We'll survive it."

"I hate this." He pulled me close. "I hate that loving me costs you so much."

"It's worth the cost."

We walked outside together, the warm night air a relief after the stuffy gym. In the parking lot, we stopped at his motorcycle.

"Can I drive you home?" Danny offered.

"Better not. If my father sees your motorcycle in our driveway, he might actually commit violence." I touched his face gently. "I'll walk. It's not far."

"I'm walking with you partway at least."

We walked through quiet streets holding hands, neither wanting to say goodbye. At the corner two blocks from my house—far enough that my parents wouldn't see if they looked out windows—we stopped.

"This is probably as far as you should go," I said.

Danny pulled me into a hug, holding tight. "I'll wait to hear from you. However long it takes, I'll wait."

"I'll write as soon as I can. Let you know what's happening."

"And Betty Ann?" He pulled back to meet my eyes. "Thank you. For tonight. For coming to find me. For being brave enough to choose this even knowing what it would cost."

"Thank you for being worth it."

He leaned down slowly, giving me time to pull away. I didn't. His lips met mine in a kiss that was soft and gentle and full of promise. It tasted like punch and possibility and everything we were fighting for.

When we finally broke apart, both of us were smiling through tears.

"I love you," I said.

"I love you too. So much."

"Then we'll figure this out. Somehow."

"Somehow," he agreed.

I forced myself to step away, to turn toward home. But I looked back once and saw Danny still standing at the corner, watching me go. I waved. He waved back.

Then I walked the final blocks to my house, where whatever consequences awaited would be faced honestly.

My window was still open. I could theoretically climb back in, pretend I'd never left. But that would be lying again, hiding again. And I was done with that.

I walked up to the front door and used my key.

Inside, the house was dark. The car was still gone—my parents hadn't returned from their church meeting yet. I checked the clock: 9:47 PM. They'd said 9:30. They'd be home any moment.

I sat on the sofa and waited.

At 9:54, car headlights swept across the front windows. The engine cut off. Doors opened and closed. Keys jingled at the lock.

The door opened and my parents entered, mid-conversation about the meeting. My father saw me first. He stopped so abruptly my mother nearly walked into him.

"Betty Ann." His voice was dangerously quiet. "How are you sitting in the living room? Your bedroom door is locked."

"I climbed out the window and went to the sock hop." I kept my voice steady. "I came back through the front door just now."

My mother made a sound like something breaking. My father's face went through several emotions—shock, fury, something that might have been respect for the audacity.

"You deliberately disobeyed—"

"Yes," I interrupted. "I did. And I need to tell you something."

Whatever he'd been about to say died in his throat. He just stared at me.

"I love Danny Cole," I said clearly. "I'm going to keep loving him whether you approve or not. So you can send me to Georgia, you can ground me until I'm thirty, you can do whatever you think is necessary. But you can't make me stop choosing him. And I won't apologize for tonight."

The words hung in the air like thrown gauntlets.

My father's face was unreadable. My mother was crying. And I sat there with my chin up and my hands steady, having finally spoken my truth completely.

Whatever came next, at least it would be honest.
