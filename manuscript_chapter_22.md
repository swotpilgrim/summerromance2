# Chapter 22: Betty Ann's Choice

Wednesday morning arrived with no reprieve from the crushing weight of my new reality. I woke early, dressed mechanically, and went downstairs to find my parents at breakfast. The silence was suffocating.

My father barely looked at me. My mother's eyes were still red from crying.

"Work today," my father said without preamble. "Back room only. No customer interaction."

"Yes, sir."

At the hardware store, I organized paint cans and counted screws while fragments of gossip drifted from the front. By now, everyone in Coral Bay knew about Saturday night. The pitying looks and whispered conversations followed me everywhere.

But the worst part was the isolation. No phone calls. No visits except Sandy's supervised half-hour. No way to reach Danny or know if he was okay.

The not-knowing was torture.

Thursday evening, my mother allowed Sandy another visit. We sat in the living room with Helen knitting in the corner, pretending not to listen to every word.

Sandy looked at me with a mixture of sympathy and frustration. "How are you holding up?"

"I've been better."

She lowered her voice. "Betty Ann, I need to tell you something. I heard from Jennifer who heard from Rico..."

My heart started pounding. "What?"

"Danny's planning to leave town. Not immediately, but soon. He thinks... he thinks he's ruining your life and the best thing he can do is remove himself from the situation."

The words hit like a physical blow. The room spun slightly.

"When?" I managed to ask.

"I don't know exactly. After things settle, probably. The race money bought his family some time, so he's thinking about leaving, finding work elsewhere, starting over." Sandy's expression was pained. "He's sacrificing himself to protect you."

Fury rose hot and sudden in my chest. "He doesn't get to do that."

"Betty Ann—"

"He doesn't get to make that choice for me!" My voice rose enough that my mother looked up sharply. I forced myself quieter. "I stood up to my father. I risked everything. I chose him, Sandy. And he's just going to leave?"

"He thinks he's doing what's best for you—"

"Then he's wrong." The certainty settled into my bones like iron. "He's making the same mistake my father is—deciding what's best for me instead of letting me choose."

Sandy glanced at my mother, then back at me. "What are you going to do? You're grounded. You can't even leave the house except for work."

I thought about Friday's sock hop. About my father's certain refusal to let me attend. About locked doors and constant supervision and threats of Georgia.

And I realized something: I'd already lost everything that mattered except Danny. My parents' trust was gone. My reputation was destroyed. My perfect-daughter image was shattered beyond repair.

What else could they take from me except my choice?

"The sock hop is Friday night," I said slowly.

"You're not allowed to go—"

"I know." I met Sandy's eyes. "I'm going anyway."

"Betty Ann, your father will send you to Georgia—"

"Maybe. Probably." I felt strangely calm about it. "But if Danny leaves because I never showed up, because I let fear win, I'll regret that for the rest of my life. Georgia would be temporary. That regret would be forever."

Sandy stared at me like she'd never seen me before. "You're serious."

"Completely serious."

"How? Your father will lock your door again—"

"Then I'll climb out my window." The plan was forming as I spoke. "Like I did for the race, except I won't get caught this time because I won't care if I do. I'll go to that sock hop. I'll find Danny. And I'll tell him he doesn't get to leave without hearing from me that I choose him."

"This is crazy," Sandy whispered.

"Probably." I smiled without humor. "But staying here saying nothing while he leaves would be crazier."

My mother cleared her throat. "Betty Ann, you need to keep your voice down."

She'd been listening. Of course she had. But her tone wasn't angry—it was worried. Sad. Like she was watching me throw my life away and couldn't stop it.

Maybe I was. But it was my life to throw.

After Sandy left, I went to my room and started planning. Friday night. The sock hop started at seven. My father would forbid me to go—that was certain. He'd probably lock my door.

But my window opened. The rose trellis was still there, one board cracked but mostly stable. I could climb down.

I'd need a cover story for how I'd get there. Sandy might help, but I couldn't ask her to risk more than she already had. Maybe I could walk. It was only two miles to the high school.

The consequences would be severe. My father would follow through on the Georgia threat—I had no doubt about that. I'd spend my senior year in a new town, away from everything familiar.

But Danny would be in Coral Bay if I could convince him to stay. We'd figure out the distance. We'd make it work somehow.

And if I couldn't convince him—if he'd already decided to leave regardless—at least I'd know I tried. At least I'd have given us a real chance.

The good daughter would stay home. Would accept the grounding. Would let Danny leave and eventually marry someone appropriate and live the safe life her father envisioned.

But I wasn't the good daughter anymore. Maybe I never really was—maybe that was just a role I'd played for seventeen years, and Saturday night had finally let me step out of character.

This was who I really was: the girl brave enough to climb out windows. To defy her father. To choose love over safety. To fight for what mattered even when the odds were impossible.

Danny had shown me that girl. Now I needed to show him I meant it.

Friday morning arrived with pale sunshine and nervous energy. I went through the motions—breakfast, work, lunch—while my mind churned with plans.

At the hardware store, I worked in the back room as ordered, but I was calculating timing. The sock hop started at seven. I'd need to be there by seven-thirty at the latest. That meant leaving home no later than seven, which meant...

"Betty Ann." My father's voice startled me from my thoughts. He stood in the doorway of the stock room, his expression unreadable. "Your mother and I are attending the church committee meeting tonight. It runs from six to nine."

My heart started pounding. "Okay."

"You'll be locked in your room. I've moved your dinner up to five-thirty so you can eat before we leave." He paused. "This is for your own good. Until you can demonstrate better judgment, this is necessary."

"Yes, sir."

After he left, I allowed myself a bitter smile. He was making it easier for me. If they left at six for their meeting, I'd have the house to myself. No risk of them hearing me climb out the window.

It was almost like fate.

At dinner, my parents made stilted conversation about the church committee while I pushed food around my plate. My mother kept watching me with sad, worried eyes. My father avoided looking at me at all.

"We'll be back around nine-thirty," my mother said as she cleared plates. "There's sandwich fixings in the refrigerator if you get hungry later."

As if I'd be here later.

At five-forty-five, my father walked me upstairs. At my bedroom door, he paused.

"Betty Ann, I want you to understand that everything I'm doing is because I love you. I'm trying to protect you from making decisions you'll regret."

"I know, Dad." And I did know. That didn't make him right.

"Someday you'll thank me for this."

I doubted it, but I nodded.

He locked the door from the outside. I heard his footsteps retreat. Heard my parents preparing to leave—keys jangling, the front door opening and closing, their car starting.

I waited until the sound of the engine faded completely. Then I moved to my window and opened it slowly, carefully.

The evening air was warm, carrying the scent of roses from the trellis. I'd changed into my best dress—the pink one with white polka dots that Sandy had mentioned in code. My good shoes. My cardigan for when evening cooled.

I threw my small purse down to the grass first. Then I climbed out.

The trellis creaked but held. I found footholds carefully, testing each board before trusting my weight to it. The broken board from last time was obvious—I avoided it completely.

Halfway down, a car passed on the street. I froze, pressing against the house, but it drove on without stopping.

Finally, my feet touched grass. I was down. I was out. I was free.

I grabbed my purse and started walking toward Coral Bay High School. Two miles. Thirty minutes if I hurried. The sock hop would be in full swing by the time I arrived.

And Danny might be there. Might give me a chance to tell him he didn't get to leave without hearing me say I chose him.

If he wasn't there—if he'd already decided—I'd deal with that when it happened.

But I wouldn't deal with never trying.

I walked through the warm Florida evening feeling terrified and exhilarated and certain. This was the line I couldn't uncross. After tonight, there was no going back to being the good daughter.

But maybe I'd never really been her anyway.

Maybe this—brave and defiant and choosing her own path—was who I'd always been underneath.

Danny had seen her. Now I needed to live as her.

Whatever came next, I'd chosen it myself.

And that, finally, was enough.
