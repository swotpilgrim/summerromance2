# Chapter 26: The Declaration

The gymnasium felt different walking back inside with Danny—hand in hand, publicly declaring ourselves. The music wrapped around us, "Only You" by The Platters playing softly from the jukebox. Couples still danced, though the crowd had thinned as the evening grew late.

But everyone who remained noticed our entrance. Conversations paused. Heads turned. The whispers started immediately, but this time I didn't care. Let them talk. Let them witness. We had nothing more to hide.

Sandy rushed over, tears still streaming down her face. "Betty Ann, that was the bravest thing I've ever seen."

"Or the stupidest," I said, but I was smiling.

"Definitely brave." She hugged me fiercely. "I'm so proud of you."

"Thank you for not trying to stop me."

"Would it have worked if I'd tried?"

"Not even a little bit."

She laughed and turned to Danny. "You better be worth all of this."

"I'll spend the rest of my life trying to be," Danny said seriously.

Sandy studied him for a moment, then nodded. "Good answer."

As she walked away, Danny pulled me toward the dance floor. The remaining couples made space for us, some smiling, others whispering. Mrs. Henderson watched from her chaperoning post near the punch table, her expression unreadable but not disapproving.

Danny's arms came around me and we began to sway. "Are you okay?" he asked quietly.

"I'm perfect." And I meant it. Despite knowing what awaited at home, despite the consequences looming, in this moment I was exactly where I needed to be.

"I meant what I said out there," Danny continued. "About proving I'm worth your choice. About finishing school properly. I'm going to do it, Betty Ann. I'm going to make you proud."

"You already make me proud."

"Then I'll keep making you proud." He pulled me slightly closer, still appropriate for a chaperoned dance but intimate in its own way. "I'm going to graduate. Save money. Open that garage I've been dreaming about. Build something real."

"We'll build it together."

"Together," he agreed.

The song changed to something upbeat—"Rock Around the Clock"—and the energy shifted. Danny spun me out and back in, both of us laughing when I stumbled slightly. We weren't good dancers, but we were happy. That counted for more.

Rico appeared during a song break, grinning widely. "Danny, man, I can't believe you actually said all that out there. That was either really brave or really stupid."

"Probably both," Danny admitted.

"Well, for what it's worth, I'm impressed. And Betty Ann?" Rico turned to me. "You're tougher than you look."

"Thanks. I think."

"It's definitely a compliment." He clapped Danny on the shoulder and disappeared back into the crowd.

More people approached as the evening went on. Some to congratulate us, others to express concern, a few to whisper warnings about my father finding out. I accepted it all with equal grace. The decision was made. There was no point in second-guessing now.

Tommy, Danny's younger brother, appeared with a girl I recognized from freshman English class. "Betty Ann! That was amazing! You told everyone how you feel and didn't care what they thought!"

"It was terrifying," I admitted.

"But you did it anyway. That's so cool." He paused. "And thanks. For making Danny stay. He was really going to leave, you know. But you stopped him."

"We stopped him together," I corrected, including Danny in the statement.

"Yeah." Tommy grinned. "We make a good team."

After he left, Danny shook his head fondly. "My little brother thinks you're a superhero now."

"I'm just a girl who climbed out a window."

"You're a girl who knew what she wanted and fought for it." Danny's voice was serious. "That's not nothing, Betty Ann."

The evening wore on. We danced to slow songs and fast ones, took breaks to drink punch and talk to classmates, existed in public as a couple for the first time. Each moment felt precious because we both knew what awaited outside this bubble.

Around ten o'clock, Mrs. Henderson approached us. "Miss Morrison, Mr. Cole. Might I have a word?"

We followed her to a quieter corner of the gym. She studied both of us with that penetrating teacher gaze that saw through every excuse and deflection.

"I'm going to call your parents tomorrow, Miss Morrison," she said. "To inform them of tonight's events."

My stomach dropped. "I understand."

"I'll also be telling them that I've never seen a student work harder than Mr. Cole did to pass his algebra exam. That he demonstrated genuine intelligence and dedication when given proper instruction." She looked at Danny. "And that he conducted himself with complete respect toward you throughout the tutoring process."

Danny's eyes widened. "Mrs. Henderson—"

"I'm not endorsing teenage rebellion," she continued. "But I am acknowledging that sometimes adults don't see the full picture. Your father has drawn conclusions about Mr. Cole based on incomplete information. I intend to provide more complete information."

"Thank you," I managed through the tightness in my throat.

"Don't thank me yet. Your father will still be furious. But perhaps he'll be slightly less furious with context." She turned to Danny. "Mr. Cole, I expect to see you in my class this fall. On time, prepared, passing."

"Yes, ma'am. You will."

"Good." She walked away, leaving us staring after her.

"Did Mrs. Henderson just offer to help?" Danny asked incredulously.

"I think she did."

"Huh." He processed this. "Maybe we have more allies than I thought."

As the sock hop began winding down—jukebox playing its last few songs, chaperones starting cleanup—Danny and I stood to the side watching. Other couples gathered belongings, made plans for after-parties, headed toward the parking lot.

Our night was ending differently. I was going home to face my father. Danny was going home to his worried mother and curious siblings. We were choosing the hard path, the honest path.

But at least we were choosing it together.

"Last dance?" Danny asked as the jukebox started playing "Unchained Melody."

"Always."

We walked onto the nearly empty dance floor. Only a few couples remained, swaying to the romantic melody. Danny held me close—closer than before, as if memorizing the moment.

"Whatever happens," he said quietly, "tonight was worth it."

"Every consequence," I agreed.

"I love you, Betty Ann Morrison."

"I love you, Danny Cole."

We swayed together as the song played, neither wanting it to end. But eventually the music stopped. The jukebox fell silent. Chaperones began turning off lights, a signal that the evening was truly over.

Danny walked me outside. The parking lot was nearly empty now, just a few cars remaining. The warm night air carried the scent of jasmine from nearby gardens.

"I should get home," I said reluctantly.

"I know." He didn't let go of my hand. "Will you let me know you're okay? Tomorrow?"

"However I can. I'll find a way to get word to you."

"Through Tommy and Rico if necessary?"

"If necessary." I squeezed his hand. "But Danny, no matter what my father says, I don't regret tonight."

"Neither do I." He pulled me into one more hug, holding tight. "You're the bravest person I know."

"I learned from you."

"We learned from each other."

We finally pulled apart. I started walking home, but looked back once. Danny stood in the parking lot watching me go, lit by streetlamps, looking like everything I wanted my future to hold.

I waved. He waved back.

Then I turned and headed toward home, where consequences awaited but truth would finally be told.
